            "El Salvador has agreed to house violent US criminals and receive deportees of any nationality, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Monday, in an unprecedented – and legally problematic deal – that hasalarmed criticsand rights groups. Rubio unveiled the agreement after meeting with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, as part of a tour of several Central American countries intended to consolidate regional support for the Trump administration’s immigration policy. “In an act of extraordinary friendship to our country … (El Salvador) has agreed to the most unprecedented and extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world,” Rubio told reporters Monday. The country will continue accepting Salvadoran deportees who illegally entered the US, he said. It will also “accept for deportation any illegal alien in the United States who is a criminal from any nationality, be they MS-13 or Tren de Aragua and house them in his jails,” he said – referring to two notorious transnational gangs with members from El Salvador and Venezuela. In addition, Bukele “has offered to house in his jails dangerous American criminals in custody in our country, including those of US citizenship and legal residents,” Rubio said. It is unclear whether the US government will take up the offer, however, with questions around the legality of such moves. Any effort by the Trump administration to deport incarcerated US nationals to another country would face significant legal pushback. “The US is absolutely prohibited from deporting US citizens, whether they are incarcerated or not,” Leti Volpp, a law professor at UC Berkeley who specializes in immigration law and citizenship theory, told CNN over email. Bukele later confirmed the agreement with Rubio on X, sayingin a post,“We are willing to take in only convicted criminals (including convicted US citizens) into our mega-prison (CECOT) in exchange for a fee.” El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, commonly referred to as CECOT, is the country’s largest and newest prison, with a maximum capacity of 40,000 inmates. “The fee would be relatively low for the US but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable,” he added. Bukele has been credited with greatly reducing gang violence in the Central American country since launching a sweeping crackdown in 2022 that has seen more than 81,000 people jailed. But while the country’s crime rate has fallen, the treatment of those imprisoned has triggered outrage among human rights organizations who call El Salvador’s prisons inhumane. The State Department’stravel advisory for El Salvadoralso warns that those imprisoned in the country face “harsh” prison conditions, without access to due process. “Overcrowding constitutes a serious threat to prisoners’ health and lives,” the advisory says. “In many facilities, provisions for sanitation, potable water, ventilation, temperature control, and lighting are inadequate or nonexistent.” Those within the Trump administration and the president’s allies have been quick to praise the announcement, with Elon Muskcalling it a “great idea”in a post on X. But rights groups condemned the agreement, and critics warned that such a plan could be part of democratic backsliding. A prominent Latino advocacy group said it was “a sad day for America” in a statement to CNN following the announcement Monday. Roman Palomares, National President and Chairman of the Board of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), said the group “opposes treating deported non-criminal migrants like cattle who can be shuttled from one country to another without regard to their home of origin.” Speaking to CNN before the announcement, Emerson College professor Mneesha Gellman said the US was “essentially proposing to send people to a country that is not the country of origin nor is it necessarily the country that they passed through.” “It is a bizarre and unprecedented proposal being made potentially between two authoritarian, populist, right wing leaders seeking a transactional relationship,” said Gellman, an international politics scholar. “It’s not rooted in any sort of legal provision and likely violates a number of international laws relating to the rights of migrants.” Manuel Flores, general secretary of El Salvador’s leftist Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front party, also decried the move on Monday. “What are we? Backyards, front yards, or garbage dumps?” he said at a press conference, referring to both El Salvador and other Central American countries receiving migrants expelled by the US. Bukele’s vast and violent crackdown on gangs has earned admiration from the Trump administration –which has targetedbothMS-13andTren de Araguain recent raids. Trump has repeatedly claimed without evidence that violent transnational gangs were taking over American cities, using both gangs as a frequent talking point to justify hardline immigration policies and border security. The president signed an executive order last month specifically naming MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, citing their “campaigns of violence and terror in the United States and internationally” as threats to “the stability of the international order in the Western Hemisphere.” The orders included a recommendation that the State Department start the process of designating Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization. On Friday, the US special envoy for Latin America Mauricio Claver-Carone hinted at the agreement between the US and El Salvador,sayingTren de Aragua members “will want to go back to Venezuela rather than having to share the prison with the Salvadorean gangs like MS-13. It’s part of what we want to discuss and how President Bukele can help us.” The move comes amid a swift immigration crackdown, with wide swaths of the federal government mobilized to arrest and detain undocumented immigrants in the US, and to strip protections for migrants already in the country. The agreement described by Rubio and Bukele for El Salvador to allow the US to send asylum seekers who are not Salvadoran to El Salvador is known as a “safe third country” agreement. Trump has threatened action against nations that will not accept flights of their nationals coming from the US, and briefly walked backfrom the brink of a damaging trade war with Colombiaover the repatriations. On Friday, Trump said Venezuela had agreed to receive Venezuelan deportees including gang members – a shift in policy after the country’s President Nicolás Maduro had also previously refused to take Venezuelan nationals back. The US had also generally been unable to send Venezuelans back due to frosty relations. The announcement came as Richard Grenell, the White House envoy for special missions, met with Maduro in Caracas – notable since Washington does not officially recognize Maduro’s presidency, with opposition leaders accusing the strongman leader of stealing last year’s elections. The Trump administration has also moved forward in removing protections for 348,000 Venezuelans already residing in the US — revoking a temporary protected status that shielded Venezuelans from deportation and allowed them to remain in the US with work permits.

            "President Donald Trump reiterated his vow to “take back” the Panama Canal on Sunday, warning of “powerful” US action in an escalating diplomatic dispute with the Central American country  over China’s presence around the vital waterway. “China is running the Panama Canal that was not given to China, that was given to Panama foolishly, but they violated the agreement, and we’re going to take it back, or something very powerful is going to happen,” Trump told reporters. Hours earlier, the diplomatic stir caused by Trump’s repeated and publicly stated desire for the US to retake control of the canal had appeared to ease after Secretary of State Marco Rubio, making his first overseas trip as the top US diplomat, met with Panama’s President Raúl Mulino. Though Mulino told Rubio that Panama’s sovereignty over the canal was not up for debate, he also said he had addressed Washington’s concerns over Beijing’s purported influence around the waterway. Panama would not renew a 2017 memorandum of understanding to join China’s overseas development initiative, known as theBelt and Roadinitiative, Mulino said, also suggesting that the deal with Beijing could end early. Mulino told reporters that Panama will seek to work with the US on new investments, including infrastructure projects. “I think this visit opens the door to build new relations … and try to increase as much as possible US investments in Panama,” he said. During the meeting, Rubio told Panama’s president and Foreign Minister Javier Martínez-Acha that concerns over China’s “control” of the Panama Canal may mean the US has to “take measures necessary to protect its rights” per a longstanding treaty on the neutrality and operation of the canal. The canal was returned to Panama undera 1977 treaty, which allows the US to intervene militarily if the waterway’s operations are disrupted by internal conflict or a foreign power. Today, more cargo than ever runs through the canal than it did during the years of US control. Mulino said Sunday he doesn’t think there is a real risk that the US would use military force to retake the canal. Mulino also said Panamanian authorities are carrying out an audit on a company linked to China that operates two terminals around the canal. “We have to wait until that audit ends before we can reach our legal conclusions and act accordingly,” Mulino said. The company in question is thePanama Ports Company, part of a subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings. Hutchinson Ports is one of the world’s largest port operators, overseeing 53 ports in 24 countries, including for other US allies such as the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. As CNN has previously reported,Hutchison does not control access to the Panama Canal. Workers at their two ports only load and unload containers onto ships and supply them with fuel. Three other ports in the vicinity of the canal are operated by competing companies providing similar services. Mulino also said Panamanian authorities spoke with Rubio about the possibility of expanding a migrant repatriation flightprogramto remove foreign nationals who don’t have the legal basis to be in Panama, insisting that the US would have to shoulder the costs. Asked to clarify if migrants would come to Panama and subsequently be transferred to their respective countries, Mulio said, “Yes. Exactly … We can do that, without a problem, under the total cost of the US. Panama won’t invest a single dollar in it.” The program,signed in July, is aimed at reducing irregular migration through the Darien Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada. Mulino said Sunday that those repatriated could include migrants from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and other countries. This story has been updated with additional information.\n",
            "Ecuador will apply a 27% tariff on Mexican goods to “ensure fair treatment” of Ecuadorian producers, President Daniel Noboa said on Monday. In apost on X, Noboa said he is open to signing a free trade deal with Mexico, but “not when there is abuse,” though did not elaborate. The president said that until a free trade deal is struck, a 27% tariff will apply to goods imported from Mexico. Ecuador imported $541 million worth of goods from Mexico in 2023, Mexicangovernment datashows. The biggest single import was medication, representing 12.6% of the goods sold from Mexico to Ecuador that year. Still, Ecuador is a miniscule trading partner for Mexico, accounting for less than 0.1% the value of Mexico’s exports last year, according to Mexican government data. The announcement comes after US President Donald Trump announced a pause on his threat of25% tariffs on all imports from Mexico, after a conversation with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. Mexico’s economic ministry did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on Ecuador’s announcement. Last year, the two countries broke off diplomatic relations following Noboa’s order of a raid on the Mexican embassy in Quito, Ecuador to arrest Jorge Glas, a former Ecuadorean vice president. Surveillancefootage from the incidentin April 2024 showed Ecuadorian police grappling with the Mexican mission’s top diplomat as they arrested Glas, who had been seeking asylum from Mexico when the raid took place. The ex-vice president had sought protection from embezzlement charges by requesting asylum in Mexico, saying that the accusations were politically motivated. Noboa, the son of a banana tycoon,swept into officein late 2023 as the youngest president in Ecuador’s history on the back of a promise to rein in the rampant crime.  Since then, he has embarked on an uncompromising agenda, including declaring “war” on more than 20 criminal gangs.\n",
            "The main room in the El Buen Samaritano shelter in Ciudad Juarez, a city along the US-Mexico border, is quiet for most of the day. Rows of bunk beds stretch from wall to wall, each separated by thin curtains or hanging sheets. The mismatched mattresses are occupied by men, women, and children – all migrants who intended to reach the United States but haven’t completed their journey. It’s the mid-morning of a cold Tuesday, most are resting or scrolling through their phones, the only noises in the room come from sporadic coughs, two children playing, and the subtle sounds from a video playing on a phone. The scene feels like a loop. At around 1 o’clock, Lucymar Polanco, a 32-year-old Venezuelan woman, checks her watch. “Kids, guys, it’s almost lunchtime,” she yells as she gets up and puts on a coat. They’re indoors but the walls are penetrated by the winter cold. “Everyone up, let’s get ready,” she says. Her husband, her three kids, and five other relatives, all start getting ready enthusiastically. Soon after, a shelter worker announces the food is ready to be served. “I’m hungry, finally!” her 9-year-old son Abel Jesus, says. Polanco and the other nine members of her family are among thousands of asylum-seekers who were stopped in their tracks by US President Donald Trump’s January 20 decision to cancel all CBP One appointments for people seeking asylum from violence or persecution. Their appointment had been set for January 21. Now, they are stranded in the shelter in Juarez with no money and full of uncertainty. From here, they can see across the border into the US – but they have no idea where to go now. For the moment, the only thing they know is that it’s time to eat. After lining up, the family - whose members range in age from 5 to 40 - head to the shelter’s dining hall. They sit together and occupy most of a communal table. As soon as they sit, they seem to put all their problems aside and focus on one another, on talking and enjoying the warm meal. The day’s menu: chicken soup and a small dish of rice and beans with canned tuna. “The most delicious soup does exist,” 9-year-old Abel Jesus says with his mouth half-full and soup dripping from the edge of his mouth. The adults chat and mostly talk about rumors they’ve heard about the CBP One app. “I heard appointments until January 30 will be reinstated,” Luis Alfonso Polanco, 30, says of a rumor that later proved to be untrue. “That’s what a friend in the US told me.” On the other side of the table, his partner Yelitza Olivero talks to two other migrants from Ecuador and shares the rumor about the app with them. At times, the family’s border chatter turns into laughter and jokes about one another. “We try to make jokes about each other, it’s a way of distracting from the news we received on January 20, it was very sad,” Lucymar’s cousin, 18-year-old Estiven Castillo, says. “The point is to support one another, so one makes a joke, and we laugh, and we try to make a nice moment, otherwise, if we just focus on our situation, we’d all get depressed, so we laugh to keep from crying,” Lucymar tells CNN. Lucymar and her family say they fled the Venezuelan state of Lara due to political persecution from authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro’s government. “We were part of an opposing political party,” she says. “My family, my parents, everyone there, and the government knew that, and we’d constantly be threatened.” “I was set to receive a house from a program run by the government but after they found out who I voted for in prior elections, they took that benefit away from me,” she says holding back tears. Prior to leaving Venezuela, both Lucymar and her brother, Luis Alfonso, worked in the beauty industry. “I was a barber in Venezuela, but things were so bad that at times I cut hair in exchange for food,” Luis Alfonso says. Lucymar’s husband, Jesus Caruci, 40, worked as a mechanic, and Yelitza, who’s married to Luis Alfonso, worked in sales. The rest of the traveling family, all young adults or children, were in school before leaving the country. Their journey began a little over two years ago. They spent a few months in neighboring Colombia to later trek through several countries. They crossed the treacherous Darien Gap safely – but were kidnapped by a cartel after arriving in southern Mexico. “When we entered Tapachula, they were waiting for us,” Luis Alfonso recalls. “They tricked us, they forced us into a vehicle and said they were taking us to a safe place (…) but they took us to a farm and held us there for six days.” Luis Alfonso says the criminal group only released after they paid $900 – all that they were carrying. “Ever since we’ve survived with some money our family has sent us or that we’ve had to borrow,” he says. Aftersobremesa, the family goes to the shelter’s patio to get some sun and continue to chat. They gather several plastic chairs that are spread out through the uneven and cracked shelter pavement and form a circle. The little kids decide to run around and play in an outdoor playset. “I understand Trump,” says 19-year-old Beyker Sosa as the family stays quiet. “There have been crimes done by illegal migrants, I understand the measures, they are meant to keep the country safe,” he adds. “But we aren’t criminals, I wish he (Trump) would have compassion, we are humans just like him.” CNN asked the family if they ever considered entering the US illegally and in chorus, they all said “no.” “We never considered entering illegally, we never want to hide from authorities, we wanted to be able to walk free,” Beyker says. “It’s very sad to have done things right, the legal way, only to have Trump shut the app down, but I guess God doesn’t want us there.” The family says their smartphones and conversation are their only form of entertainment in the shelter. “We can’t even go out, we were warned that migrants are targeted in this area, so we just stay in, especially after already being kidnapped,” Lucymar says. Still, with kids to entertain, snacks are a must. Luis Alfonso and Estiven go to a store around the corner to buy cookies and soda. As they return, they rejoin the conversation and start passing around Oreos and a plastic cup with orange soda. “Trump should clean up Venezuela, we are good people, but he should up take out the bad ones, especially those in the government, take them out, Trump, and then take our country and call it Venezuela of America,” Beyker jokes as he refers to Trump’s bid to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Nearly two hours later, the family is back in the main room of the shelter with each settling into their beds again. “This is all we do, we are either in our beds, on our phones, we wonder what could’ve been,” Lucymar says.\n",
            "Could a ceasefire deal be a disaster forUkrainein disguise? That is the urgent question echoing in Ukrainian frontline bunkers and in the ruins of besieged towns, where ubiquitous exhaustion begs for peace, but where a costly learned distrust ofRussiarules. Anxiety is manifold. Would a ceasefire hold? Would Russia just use it to re-equip and attack again? Would Moscow even want it, given it is fast winning ground? Would Ukraine’s allies give it the same military support, if they felt diplomacy had led the guns to fall silent? The screens before Volodymyr Sablyn, a battalion commander in the 66th mechanized brigade, tell a gut-wrenching story of Ukraine’s modern, yet archaically brutal battlefield. Tiny, cheap drones fly over the pockmarked and battered trenches around Lyman – a mix of frozen sludge, trash, bunkers and “beetroot,” the ugly term for human remains that cannot be retrieved. “If there is a ceasefire now, it will only get worse for us”, Sablyn told CNN this week. “Because the enemy will restore itself, form new military units, regroup and attack again.” Sablyn joined the army in February 2015, when Russian separatists took the Donetsk town of Debaltseve despite agreeing to a truce. Now, across the eastern front, ceasefires called a decade ago that provided little but cover for further Russian military advances are living proof of the urgent need for caution at the negotiating table. The scene Sablyn commands is one where relentless Russian assaults and tolerance of casualties has exploited Kyiv’s key weakness: a lack of infantry. As Sablyn’s forces drop mortars on Lyman’s frontlines, Moscow’s forces are advancing on a vital military hub to his south – Pokrovsk. The pace of its encirclement is startling and, once it falls, Russia will have few major settlements between its forces and the major cities of Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia. Hope is a key currency here, and one facet of it, consistently raised by Ukrainian officials, is the idea of European or NATO troops providing security guarantees to Kyiv through their specific presence in frontline areas – as peacekeepers of sorts. A European defense official told CNN recently there were “active discussions” about similar assistance. A ceasefire, followed by European NATO members manning a de-militarized zone is a key tenet of a peace plan floated by US President Donald Trump’s new Ukraine envoy, Gen. Keith Kellogg, in a policy paper from April. “If NATO could send troops to Ukraine,” said Sablyn, “it would be a guarantee of security in Ukraine. Because Russia – no matter how much they say that they are not afraid of anyone – are afraid of America, are afraid of NATO as a whole.” Yet as dusk settles near the 66th’s forward artillery units, the idea seems beset with insurmountable risk. The threat of Russian drones is so acute, artillery units can be reached when the sun tips into the horizon, and the light is vanishing. A unit commander who escorts us checks his handheld monitor to see if the Russian surveillance drones have left. We pause for 10 minutes until the all-clear is given and then race across the rocky fields to a tree-line where aging artillery guns deal regular “suppressing fire” to the Russians. Peace is something here you better be deadly serious about, and the men who live underground are skeptical about. “There is only a 30% chance of a ceasefire,” said one soldier, Viktor. “Because the situation on the front is not in such a way that we can see that there will be a truce. It’s all very difficult.” Another, Andriy, added: “I think it’s 40%. The other side is winning, taking territories. And we, by and large, have nothing to say.” CNN is not including the full names of several people we spoke to, because of security concerns. The growing candor of troops who would months ago repeat only studied assurances of victory is replicated by some exhausted civilians from frontline towns. Slowly trudging through the ravaged streets of Lyman is Larysa, 72, her gold incisors bright among the shell-peppered concrete. “We’ve been hit 19 times today… 19 times since this morning,” she told CNN. “My husband is counting, and I’m taking sleeping pills. And then he wakes me up and says: ‘Well, did you count?’” She becomes tearful when asked why she has not left a town first taken in the Russian invasion of 2022, then liberated by Ukrainian forces later that year, and now heavily pressured by Putin’s men again, who are about 10 kilometres (6.2 miles) from its outskirts. “Here, I ran barefoot; there, I swam in the river,” she said, gesturing to the town’s edges. I am 72, I don’t want to (leave). All my three brothers are buried here, all my aunts, uncles, dad, mum. I can’t leave.” She has scant sympathy for Kyiv, describing the Ukrainian soldiers she meets in supermarkets as unkempt, and saying a friend’s family of seven left Lyman two weeks earlier and were housed in a stable in nearby Poltava. “A stable! But it was clean and there was some hay.” Larysa said Trump will be no different to Biden, who she had heard on television tried to buy parts of eastern Ukraine for his son, likely echoing false Russian propaganda. Her hopes are with the Kremlin as the decision-makers. “Nobody’s going to solve this. Only Putin will if he says, ‘that’s enough, I’ve already killed so many people.’” She nods when asked if peace through Putin is the only path ahead. Behind her, a bus collects locals who still shuffle in and out of the desolate town to go shopping. None will talk except the driver, Dima, who says he went to Russia when the Russians first invaded to stay with relatives and recently came back. He says he is used to the destruction and hopeful for peace. “It’s all politics. Nothing depends on us. As it is decided, so it will be.” For others, there has been a decade of turmoil and loss. Inesa, 60, sits alone in the central square of Slovyansk, where 10 years ago Russian proxy separatists seized the local administration building and fought off the Ukrainian army, over repeated ceasefires, deals and Russian advances. She said a decade earlier, despite the chaos of separatism, they still had jobs and hope. Now she and her mother are all that remains in Slovyansk, a key Russian target in Donetsk, the rest of her family scattered, she said, across the world by war. “Now there is no future,” she said. “We don’t see it. Who does? I want it just to stop. Stop the bombing.”\n",
            "Taiwanese actor Barbie Hsu, one of the most prominent stars in the Chinese-speaking world, has died of a flu-related illness at age 48, Taiwan’s official Central News Agency reported Monday, citing her sister. Hsu died of pneumonia after catching the flu during a family holiday in Japan, her younger sister Dee Hsu said in a statement shared by her agent, CNA reported. “I am grateful that I could be her sister in this life, to take care and accompany each other,” Dee Hsu said. “I will always be grateful to her and miss her.” The star had faced poor health in recent years, her sister previously said on television. Widely known as “Big S,” Hsu rose to fame at age 17 in the mid-1990s alongside her younger sister in Mandapop duo S.O.S. The siblings were known for their sharp sense of humor, underscored when both became popular talk show hosts. But it was Hsu’s lead role in the iconic 2001 television drama “Meteor Garden” that catapulted her to fame across the region as her portrayal of an ordinary girl who finds love with a rich boy resonated with millions of fans. On Monday, “Big S passed away” became the top trending topic on China’s Weibo social media platform, amassing over 1.5 billion views, as shocked fans mourned the star. “This is really hard to believe,” a top comment with more than 54,000 likes said. “It was so sudden, life is too short,” said another. Many Chinese celebrities also expressed shock over Hsu’s death. “What a bolt from the blue,” her “Meteor Garden” co-star Ken Chu wrote on Weibo. Hsu retired from the entertainment industry in 2022 following the end of her 11-year marriage to Chinese businessman Wang Xiaofei, a hot topic on social media on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. She is survived by her husband, Korean rapper Koo Jun-yup, and two children from her previous marriage.\n",
            "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke to Elon Musk “on issues of misinformation and distortions about South Africa,” the presidency announced on Tuesday. “In the process, the President reiterated South Africa’s constitutionally embedded values of the respect for the rule of law, justice, fairness and equality,” it said. The presidency said the pair spoke on Monday, a day after US President Donald Trumpthreatenedto cut off aid to South Africa over the alleged mistreatment of White farmers in the country. In a blistering post on Truth Social, Trump said he would halt funding until there was a full investigation into allegations that “South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY.” Trump said “massive” human rights violations were happening in South Africa “for all to see,” without giving details or providing evidence. Ramaphosa on Monday denied that South African authorities were “confiscating land” and said his country was looking forward to working with the Trump administration “over our land reform policy.” Trump’s complaint, which he also made in 2018 during his first term in the White House, refers to South Africa’s complex land reform. During South Africa’s apartheid era, racist policies forcefully removed Black and non-White South Africans from the land for White use. Since South Africa’s first democratic elections in 1994, there has been a land redistribution and restitution provision in the country’s constitution. However, unemployment and poverty remain acute among Black South Africans, who make up around 80% of the population, yet own a fraction of the land. Last month, Ramaphosa signed a bill into law providing new guidelines for land expropriation, including enabling the government to expropriate land without compensation in certain cases. Musk, a South African-born billionaire and head of the US’ new Department of Government Efficiency, had previously criticized Ramaphosa’s new policy. In a post on X, the website he owns, Musk on Monday accused Ramaphosa of having “openly racist ownership laws.” Ramaphosa had said earlier that, like the United States and other countries, South Africa has “always had expropriation laws that balance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners.” Responding to Trump’s aid threat, Ramaphosa said that, other than a major HIV/AIDS relief program, the US did not provide significant funding to South Africa.\n",
            "The founder of a pro-Russian militia group in eastern Ukraine, described by authorities in Kyiv as a “criminal mastermind”, has died following a bombing in central Moscow, according to Russian state media. Armen Sarkisyan died Monday at a Moscow hospital from injuries sustained in an explosion in an upmarket residential complex in the capital city, TASS quoted the medical services as saying. The Russian Investigative Committee later confirmed Sarkisyan’s death, stating that “despite the assistance provided, one of the victims died in a medical facility.” Sarkisyan, also known by nickname “Armen Gorlovsky” after Horlivka (Gorlovka in Russian) the eastern Ukrainian town he is from, founded the separatist Arbat Battalion fighting in the region. Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence described him as a “well-known criminal mastermind” who became the “supervisor” of prisons across Russia and occupied territories of Ukraine in November 2022. The Ukrainian Defense Intelligence said the founding of Arbat in 2022 was an attempt to counterbalance the influence of Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin in the Russian private military company sector.Prigozhin was killedthe following year when his plane crashed two months after his attempted mutiny against Russia’s leadership. The battalion fought in several key battles of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) previously said. Arbat was composed “almost entirely” of former Wagner personnel, the US-based conflict monitor said in October 2023. Sarkisyan was an ally of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, the Russian-leaning leader who wasoustedfollowing deadly protests in Ukraine in 2014 and fled to Russia, according to Ukrainian authorities. Sarkisyan was wanted in Ukraine for his alleged role in the violent response to those demonstrations against Yanukovych. Sarkisyan was leaving the exclusive Aliye Parusa residential complex in northwest Moscow on Monday morning when the explosion happened, a local resident said in a video published by the independent Russian media outlet SOTA. Asked about the incident during a press briefing on Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “The special services are doing their job. It is difficult work. The information is being clarified, and work is ongoing, so it is impossible for us to comment on anything at this time.”\n",
            "Food distribution is being stopped. Health services are being shut down. Lifesaving aid is being tied up, with no way to disburse it. These aren’t warnings of what’s to come, but examples of what aid workers say is the fallout of the Trump administration’sfreeze on foreign aidand the gutting of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). “It’s heartbreaking for our beneficiaries, for whom this is life and death,” a USAID worker said. Another USAID employee told CNN that they have been grappling with “the absolute shock from our partners,” as stop-work orders continue into a second week, and the reliability of US partnership is called into question. “We have programs in Ukraine, we have programs in Burma, in Sudan, in some of the most complicated, dangerous places in the world, where there are just massive humanitarian needs,” the USAID employee said. “All of that is stopped. All of that is paused.” Almost all USAID workers and partners that spoke to CNN asked that neither their names nor any identifying information about their work be published, for fear of losing their jobs or losing future funding for their projects. “We do work that we think is really important for America’s power and stability abroad. We don’t do this work because it’s nice. We do it because it buys us much more, and it gives us much more than we are giving,” the USAID employee added. “It’s devastating to see this on a personal level, and I just think it’s so foolhardy on a global level.” Despite the administration saying that it has issued waivers for all programs involving life-saving humanitarian aid and food assistance, multiple USAID employees and contractors told CNN that funding for them continues to be halted. “The waiver is 100% meaningless to us,” a USAID official told CNN, explaining that much of the work on the ground is done by partners who front the money and then get reimbursed. “We’re not processing any of those payments, so the waiver itself is largely meaningless if you can’t get paid.” “ Meanwhile, thousands of Americans and people abroad arelosing their jobs, as the entire aid industry reels from unpaid contracts. These are a small selection of countries and programs severely affected by the aid freeze. USAID supports hundreds of projects focused on water security, in Jordan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, and dozens of other nations. An estimated 4 billion people globally don’t have access to safe drinking water. Without those programs, “animals die, people die, people are displaced,” said Evan Thomas, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Colorado in Boulder. He works on a project in Kenya that helps more than 1 million people access clean water, via 200 deep groundwater pumps installed and partially funded by USAID. Now, the program is unable to pay contracts with people hired to help maintain and repair the pumps. “That entire program is now at risk of falling apart,” he said. “When people don’t have water, when their livestock die, they become very stressed, and there are militias that are willing to take advantage of that stress and recruit for their own aims,” said Thomas, citing concerns about the rising influence of terror groupAl-Shabaab inKenya. “Undermining the access of people around the world to food and water and medicine is not going to make America more secure.” “People don’t just sit around and die of thirst. They move. They migrate. And so this will create increased migration pressure everywhere in the world,” Thomas added. Elsewhere in Kenya, other USAID-funded projects help improve care for HIV/AIDS patients are also being disrupted. In Sudan, food kitchens funded by US aid are already shutting down, according to Jeremy Konyndyk, the president of Refugees International and a former USAID official. It comes as the UN reports millions of families, many displaced, are experiencing crisis levels of hunger amid the country’s ongoing conflict. “A lot of displaced people and a lot of people who are caught in famine and other crises could be harmed, if not gravely harmed, if not killed by this pullback of aid,” said Konyndyk, warning of the wide-reaching impact on refugees in Sudan, Syria and Gaza. The US system for monitoring global famine, FEWSNET, which is used throughout the world, has also been shut down amid the Trump administration’s aid freeze. “USAID has been a cornerstone of lifesaving initiatives in famine-stricken regions such as Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan, but the funding freeze leaves millions without access to essential services like health care, clean water, and shelter,” according to the executive director of the International Council of Voluntary Agencies, Jamie Munn. USAID spearheads a program to control and eliminate malaria in 24 of the hardest-hit African nations, including Mali, where malaria is the leading cause of mortality. The aid agency funds and delivers antimalarial medications, test-kits and insecticide-treated bug nets, which save lives and help reduce the number of mosquitos. One former USAID contractor told CNN that her projects to deliver those lifesaving supplies are now halted, and no one knows what will happen to the drugs they already procured. She and her coworkers at the contract company running the projects have all been laid off. Malaria still kills about 600,000 people each year worldwide – most of them children under the age of five. But in the countries where the USAID-run President’s Malaria Initiative operates, the mortality rate has been cut in half since George W. Bush launched it in 2006. “One of the reasons that we don’t have malaria in the US is because we fund and track malaria worldwide, for global health security,” the contractor said. “So, thecases that everyone saw in Floridathis past year would become an increasingly common occurrence if we’re not funding driving down the parasite elsewhere.” Life-saving programs for 145,000 vulnerable women in Afghanistan in need of safe houses, mental health counseling, health care and vocational training are now frozen, a source familiar with the aid halt told CNN. It comes at a time when theTaliban rule is becoming increasingly repressiveand brutal to women. Afghanistan “faces severe repercussions as the funding pause disrupts education programmes, healthcare delivery, and women’s empowerment initiatives, undermining long-term recovery and stability,” the International Council of Voluntary Agencies said in a statement. Meanwhile, more than 6 million people in the country are surviving on “just bread and tea,” World Food Program (WFP) Country Director for Afghanistan Hsiao-Wei Lee told Reuters. She is concerned about the aid freeze given that the WFP is already running on half the funding it needs in Afghanistan. The WFP received 54% of its funding last year from the US, according to the UN. USAID funds backup heating systems to schools and hospitals in 14 regions of Ukraine, which are invaluable amid Russia’s continued attacks on the country’s energy infrastructure, according to the USAID Ukraine account on ‘X.’ That account has since been taken offline. USAID also assists with equipment delivery to energy workers, for example in the southern city of Odesa, which was recently hit in one of Russia’s assaults on Ukraine’s energy supplies. Funding for these programs, as well as others focused on food security and veterans’ rehabilitation has been frozen, according to nonprofits in the country. Lawmakers in the Ukrainian parliament have made a plea for continued USAID assistance, which also funds programs that enable thousands of children to continue their education and support children impacted psychologically by the war. USAID funding further supports Ukrainian media outlets, in an effort to keep them going amid economic hardship and counter Russian media and propaganda. “The grants have become a pillar of support for many domestic media outlets, as the advertising market, which helped the media survive, has not yet revived after the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation,” the Ukrainian Parliament’s Committee on Humanitarian and Information Policy said last week. In Colombia, USAID funds and operates programs related to counter-narcotics, emergency food assistance, combatting deforestation and more. Donors and organizations working on the ground have expressed huge concerns about the sudden drop off in aid, especially as the country faces an escalation in violence and a humanitarian crisis in the Catatumbo region, a strategic territory for drug production. “We’ve tried to explain that (the aid freeze) is both going to destabilize the Venezuelan and Colombian border, but also destabilize the internal conflict, and that is one of the largest coca-growing areas in the country,” said one aid worker, highlighting concerns about an uptick in drug trafficking as well as local people suffering. Non-governmental aid workers in the Latin America region have compiled a list of current USAID projects they say are designed to counter immigration and combat the influence of cartels, with that work now halted in Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The impacts are far wider than a handful of countries, of course, with international nonprofits warning about consequences on every continent. “I think the entire humanitarian system could collapse because we fund about 40% of it,” the USAID official added. According to UN officials, theUS funds around 47% of global humanitarian aid. The country is the largest provider of humanitarian assistance globally, although it accounts for less than 1% of the federal budget. Speaking to the press in El Salvador on Monday,Rubio saidthe “functions of USAID” must align with US foreign policy and that it is “a completely unresponsive agency.” When asked about the arguments that USAID’s work is vital to national security and promoting US interests, Rubio said, “There are things that USAID, that we do through USAID, that we should continue to do, and we will continue to do.” Since it was established by Congress in 1961, USAID “has brought lifesaving medicines, food, clean water, assistance for farmers, kept women and girls safe, promoted peace, and so much more over decades, all for less than one percent of our federal budget,” Oxfam America President Abby Maxman said in a statement. “Ending USAID as we know it would undo hard-earned gains in the fight against poverty and humanitarian crisis, and cause long-term, irreparable harm.”\n",
            "An attack on an open market in the Sudanese city of Omdurman by a paramilitary group fighting against the country’s military killed some 54 people and wounded many more, health authorities said Saturday. The attack by the Rapid Support Forces on the Sabrein Market also wounded at least 158 others, the Health Ministry said in a statement. It was the latest in a series of deadly attacks in the escalated civil war that has wrecked the northeastern African country. There was no immediate comment from the RSF. Khalid al-Aleisir, minister of culture and government spokesperson, condemned the attack, saying that the casualties included many women and children. He also said the attack caused “widespread destruction to private and public properties.” “This criminal act adds to the bloody record of this militia,” he said in a statement. “It constitutes a blatant violation of international humanitarian law.” Sudan’s Doctors Syndicate condemned the RSF’s attack. It said one shell hit meters away from al-Naw hospital, which received most of the market casualties. It said most of the bodies taken to the hospital were of women and children, adding that the hospital has a significant shortage of medical teams, especially surgeons and nurses. The conflict in Sudan started in April 2023 when simmering tensions between the leaders of the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and other cities across the sprawling northeastern African country. Saturday’s attack was the latest tragedy in the country’s brutal civil war. Last week,about 70 people were killedin a RSF attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in the western region of Darfur. The conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, has forced millions to flee their homes and has left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. It has been marked by gross atrocities including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according the United Nations and rights groups. The International Criminal Court said it was investigatingalleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.And the Biden administration accused the RSF and its proxies of committinggenocidein the war. In recent months the RSF has suffered multiple battlefield blows, giving the military the upper hand in the war. It has lost control of many areas in Khartoum, the capital’s sister city of Omdurman, and the eastern and central provinces. The military also regained control of the city ofWad Medani, the capital of Gezira province, andthe country’s largest oil refinery.\n",
            "US President Donald Trump has said he wants access to Ukraine’s mineral deposits in exchange for future military aid that Kyiv needs as it continues to defend itself against Russia’s aggression. While the comment highlighted Trump’s transactional approach to the war in Ukraine, it was not entirely unexpected. The US and other Western countries have eyed Ukraine’s mineral riches for a long time. “We’re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earths. And I want security of the rare earth, and they’re willing to do (that),” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, without specifying what, if anything, Ukraine had agreed to do. He has previously suggested that any future assistance should be provided as a loan and would be conditioned on Ukraine negotiating with Russia. Under former US President Joe Biden, the US had provided Ukraine with $65.9 billion in military assistance since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022. Biden argued the aid was necessary because Ukraine’s victory was key to America’s own security. Trump, however, has made it clear he doesn’t believe the US should continue providing assistance without getting something in return. While Trump did not give any details on what he wants from Kyiv, a deal outlining a deeper cooperation between the US and Ukraine on minerals had been in the works for months before he took office in January. A memorandum of understanding prepared under the Biden administration last year said the US would promote investment opportunities in Ukraine’s mining projects to American companies in exchange for Kyiv creating economic incentives and implementing good business and environmental practices. Ukraine already has a similar agreement with the European Union, signed in 2021. Adam Mycyk, a partner in the Kyiv office of the global law firm Dentons, said that while the objective of the deal – securing critical mineral supplies from Ukraine – remains unchanged, Trump’s approach seems to be more transactional. “It remains to be seen what form such an agreement could take, but it would be in Ukraine’s best interests for its post-war recovery and long-term economic prospects to maximize as much as possible the processing and value creation of any extracted minerals in Ukraine by Ukrainian companies,” Mycyk told CNN. Kyiv has not yet responded to Trump’s comments, but the Ukrainian government has in the past made the argument that its mineral deposits are one of the reasons the West should support Ukraine – to prevent these strategically important resources from falling into Russian hands. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has specifically mentioned the possibility of future investments in the country’s natural resources by its Western allies as a key part of his “Victory plan.” “The deposits of critical resources in Ukraine, along with Ukraine’s globally important energy and food production potential, are among the key predatory objectives of the Russian Federation in this war. And this is our opportunity for growth,” Zelensky said in a statement outlining the plan in October. Nataliya Katser-Buchkovska, the co-founder of the Ukrainian Sustainable Investment Fund, said a deal that would bring US investment into Ukraine’s mining sector would be beneficial for both sides. The US largely depends on imports for the minerals it needs, many of which come from China. Of the 50 minerals classed as critical, the US was entirely dependent on imports of 12 and more than 50% dependent on imports of a further 16, according to the United States Geological Survey, a government agency. Ukraine, meanwhile, has deposits of 22 of these 50 critical materials, according to the Ukrainian government. “It is not only a crucial step for Ukraine’s post-war economic recovery, but it’s also a chance for the US to address global supply chain issues,” said Katser-Buchkovska, who served as a member of the Ukrainian Parliament from 2014 to 2019 and was the head of a parliamentary committee on energy security and transition. Although Trump used the term “rare earths,” it is unclear whether he intended to refer specifically to rare earth minerals – a group of 17 elements that exist in the earth’s core and have magnetic and conductive properties that make them crucial to the production of electronics, clean energy technologies and some weapon systems. Ukraine doesn’t have globally significant reserves of rare earth minerals, but it does have some of the world’s largest deposits of graphite, lithium, titanium, beryllium and uranium, all of which are classed by the US as critical minerals. Some of these reserves are in areas that are currently under Russian occupation. China has long dominated the global production of rare earth minerals and other strategically important materials. It is responsible for nearly 90% of global processing of rare earth minerals, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). On top of that, China is also the world’s largest producer of graphite and titanium, and a major processor of lithium. The latest trade spat between Washington and Beijing makes it even more important for the US to look for alternative suppliers. Theeconomic measures Chinaannounced on Tuesday in retaliation for Trump’s new tariffs include new export controls on more than two dozen metal products and related technologies. While they do not cover the most critical materials the US needs, the move indicates that China is prepared to use its mineral riches as leverage in trade disputes. Mycyk said that the demand for these critical materials is expected to surge because of the global transition to electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies. “Ukraine’s deposits are thus globally significant, offering diversification away from dominant producers like China. Keeping these resources under Ukrainian control is crucial for maintaining its economic sovereignty,” he added.\n",
            "Kensington Place released a photo of a smiling Princess of Wales in honor of World Cancer Day on Monday. According to the palace’s post on X, the photo was taken by her six-year old son Prince Louis. It shows Catherine with arms outstretched atop a log in a forest. “Don’t forget to nurture all that lies beyond the disease,” reads the short caption, signed “C.” Catherine last month revealed that she is in remission from cancer. “As anyone who has experienced a cancer diagnosis will know, it takes time to adjust to a new normal,” she said in a post on X in January. “I am however looking forward to a fulfilling year ahead. There is much to look forward to. Thank you to everyone for your continued support.” Catherine, who is also known as Kate, stepped back from her public duties last year to undergo treatment for an unspecified cancer. In September, sheannouncedthat she had completed her chemotherapy, and said she was “doing what I can to stay cancer free.”\n",
            "Researchers inCyprushave discovered a hidden portrait that lay undetected for centuries beneath a 1570 oil painting by Renaissance masterTitian, a rendering of which is now on display in the city of Limassol. The newly discovered work shows a unidentified man with a thin mustache, quill in hand, standing next to a stack of papers or books - a prosaic image compared to the scene of Jesus Christ, bound and wearing a crown of thorns, that Titian later painted over it. The painting “holds a secret, and the secret is that there is, unknown until now, a painting underneath,” said professor Nikolas Bakirtzis, who leads a team at the Cyprus Institute (CyI), a non-profit educational body. The finished artwork, called “Ecce Homo” - meaning “Behold, The Man” in English - shows Jesus standing next to Pontius Pilate, who presided over the last stages of Jesus’ trial before he was crucified. The painting was being prepared for conservation when researchers put it under a microscope and noticed different pigments through the craquelure, or pattern of fine cracks that form on the surface of old paintings. “It was like uncovering a puzzle,” said Bakirtzis. Using a combination of imaging and non-invasive analytical techniques, researchers at the Andreas Pittas Art Characterization Laboratories (APAC) at CyI pieced together the full, buried portrait. Based on the X-ray visuals, experts then created an oil painting of the man. “It is clearly the portrait of a banker, a lawyer, some professional man in his workspace,” said Bakirtzis, an art and architectural historian who is the director at APAC. An exhibit of Titian’s painting as well as a rendering of the hidden portrait opened in Limassol in late January and runs until March 10. Born Tiziano Vecellio in 1488, Titian, together with his studio in Venice, produced hundreds of paintings until his death in 1576. Researchers know that he re-used canvases on partially-finished work. In this instance, it was a full portrait, which he turned upside down and painted over with “Ecce Homo.” “I am not aware of any case where we can safely map the direct painting of a composition over an earlier one,” Bakirtzis said. Bakirtzis believes Titian used elements of the earlier painting for the new one, including using the man’s jawline to outline the ropes tying Christ’s wrists. “This shows the hand of a confident artist. The leader, the head of the studio, Titian himself… and this is why this ‘Ecce Homo’ version is the one which preserves Titian’s artistry,” he said.\n",
            "Hamason Saturday released three Israeli hostages from captivity in two orderly handover ceremonies that stood in marked contrast tochaotic scenesearlier this week. After 484 days in Gaza, Keith Siegel, Yarden Bibas, and Ofer Kalderon returned to Israeli soil. Stepping off a military helicopter just outside Tel Aviv, Kalderon, 54 - who also holds French citizenship - stopped to wave to friends who had gathered outside Shiba Hospital, smiling and yelling, “I love you!” In a tearful embrace in a hospital room, his four children wept as they pulled him in and stroked his hair. “It’s over, Dad,” his daughter said. “Now you’re with us.” In exchange, Israel released 183 Palestinian prisoners, of whom 18 were serving life sentences. The majority had been detained in Gaza since October 7 and had no public charges against them. And for the first time since it was captured by Israeli forces in May 2024, the crucial Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened to allow a group ofPalestinian civilians, mostly children, to be evacuated for medical treatment. It is the fourth hostage exchange since a ceasefire went into effect on January 19. Under an agreement signed in Qatar last month, negotiations to begin a second phase are supposed to begin on Monday. There are still 79 people taken on October 7, 2023, left in Gaza. Only 20 of those are scheduled to come out during this phase of the truce, of whom eight are said to be dead. Siegel, 65, who has long lived in Israel, is the first American released since the ceasefire that began on January 19. Amid the rubble of Gaza City’s port, he appeared frail as militants walked him to a car. He waved briefly from a stage that had been set up. His wife Aviva, watching a feed of him being freed in Gaza, exclaimed, “Here he is, here he is, Keith!” as she embraced their son Shai. Bibas’s children have become among the most prominent hostages held by Hamas. His son Kfir was just nine months when he was abducted, the youngest hostage taken on October 7, 2023. Kfir, his brother Ariel, and their mother Shiri have not been seen since they were taken captive. Hamas claimed in November 2023 that they were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel never confirmed their deaths. Yarden Bibas’ reunion with his sister Ofri and father Eli was decidedly more somber. Meeting at Re’im Military Base in southern Israel, the three held each other in a deep embrace, and wept. “There are no words to describe the relief of holding Yarden in our hands, embracing him, and hearing his voice,” the Bibas family said in statement, adding they “continue with hope” for the return of his wife and sons. The release of the three men Saturday was particularly weighty in Israel because of the disorderly scenes that surrounded the release of two Israeli and five Thai hostages in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, on Thursday. Thousands of Palestinian jostled the two Israelis as they were escorted to Red Cross vehicles. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded assurances from the intermediaries who negotiated the ceasefire that the scenes would not be repeated. The message seems to have been received. On a bright Saturday morning, masked militants from Hamas’ Qassam Brigades took to stages adorned with anti-Israel banners, honoring their fallen military commander Muhammad Al-Masri, better known as Muhammad Al-Deif, whose assassination by Israel last July was acknowledged by Hamas this week. Representatives from the International Committee for the Red Cross signed release papers provided by the Hamas militants, and the hostages were briefly paraded on stage and made to wave to the crowd before being whisked away to be transferred to the Israeli military. The release of Palestinian prisoners from Israel’s Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank also brought jubilation to crowds who gathered for their release in Ramallah. Huge crowds swarmed a Red Cross bus as freed prisoners draped in keffiyehs floated into the arms of supporters. Among the prisoners released was Mohammad El-Halabi, the director of the Gaza branch of World Vision, a US-based humanitarian organization. El-Halabi was arrested in 2016, and later found guilty of diverting money from humanitarian projects to Hamas’ military wing. World Visiondeniedthe allegations at the time and said the legal process was unfair. Following his release Saturday, El-Halabi told CNN that he had lost 40 kilograms (88 lb) of weight in detention since October 7. “The food was not even sufficient for a small child – it was deliberately inadequate. The quality was also terrible… there was a famine inside the prison,” he told CNN, adding that dozens of prisoners fainted every day due to malnutrition. “Thank God I got out of prison,” he said. A number of those released were immediately transferred to hospitals in Ramallah due to their health condition, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Media office. “Hamas got the message from Israel through Qatar to avoid the chaos we witnessed last Thursday,” Gershon Baskin, a veteran Israeli negotiator who is often in touch with Palestinian colleagues, said in a statement. “Hamas may be able to make a strong show of their control, but the people of Gaza have witnessed the destruction all around them and hold Hamas responsible, along with Israel of course.” “There is no military victory over Hamas, that should be clear to all. The are no winners in this war. We have all lost,” Bashkin added.\n",
            "Winter is finally living up to its name in the Northeast — at least partially. It’s beenbitterly coldthis winter, but many cities are still lagging behind on their typical snow. February could change that. The ingredients needed to create blockbuster winter storms historically tend to align this month. Most of them are already in place now, and just need a storm to take the elusive right track to unlock winter’s full potential. Trace a path along Interstate 95 from Virginia to Maine and nearly every city along and east of the busy roadway typically gets more snow in February than any other month. More impactful Northeast snowstorms, many of which arepowerful nor’easters, occur in February than any other month,according to a scale used to rank snowstormsfrom NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. That’s because peak snowiness in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast is tied to the Atlantic Ocean. Sea surface temperatures along the immediate Atlantic Coast start the winter relatively warm — large bodies of water are slow to shed heat from the summer and fall. Any storms that interact with this warmth are more likely to deliver rain than snow. Sea surface temperatures near the coast usually cool off by February and allow coastal storms like nor’easters to tap into colder air and produce more snow instead of rain. Sea surface temperatures near the coast are currently at or below normal from northern New England all the way to parts of the Carolinas after multiple bouts of brutally cold air swept over the eastern half of the US, according toNOAA data. Ocean conditions are ripe near the Atlantic coast, but a few other factors need to align for a major snowstorm in the Northeast. Cold air is a huge factor, and this season has put recent winters to shame: It’s on track to be one of the 10-coldest winters for dozens of Eastern Seaboard locales, according to data from the Southeast Regional Climate Center. More cold is on the way that could help set the stage for a big snowstorm. Warmer than normal air will stick around through the weekend for much of the mid-Atlantic, but colder air will arrive next week for the Northeast and start to cool off the rest of the Eastern Seaboard, too. Some weather forecast models are hinting at the potential return of widespread, bone-chilling cold later in the month. Cold air and cool sea surface temperatures could be in place all season, but it’s not going to snow until a storm arrives that can tap into them. Most storms packing a big winter punch have tracked farther south than normal, missing the region. La Niña could also play a role in Northeast snow.La Niña conditions arrivedmid-winter. La Niña and its counterpart El Niño typically have a predictable and outsized effect on winter weather in the US, but this La Niña is quite weak, which muddles its influence. A typical La Niña winter pattern would dictate warmer than normal conditions for much of the mid-Atlantic and southernmost parts of the Northeast — bad news for snow. Weak La Niñas also tend to give New Englandmore snowthan normal. Neither outcome has come to pass so far: Washington, DC, was buried in snow in January while New England has longed for it. The last couple of winters in the Northeast were decidedly un-winterlike. Last winter was thewarmest on recordin both the Northeast and the entire Lower 48. The winter before is tied for the third-warmest in the Northeast. Winter is thefastest-warming seasonfor nearly 75% of the US as the planet warms because of fossil fuel pollution.  Unseasonable warmth andlackluster snow totalsgo hand-in-hand, andsnowfall is decliningaround the globe. New York City has a snowfall deficit of more than 3 feet over the past two winters. Snow is still lagging this season despite the cold; the city should typically record at least a foot of snow from December through the end of January but just under 6 inches has fallen. Other cities in the I-95 corridor – with the exception of Washington, DC, and Baltimore – are also running behind this season. Both Philadelphia and Boston recorded only half of the snow that typically falls from December through January. Even New Orleans has had more snow than New York City – and almost as much snow as New York City and Philadelphia combined – after ahistoric stormdumped 8 inches on the city in January. There are a couple of chances for snow this week that don’t appear to be a major storms, but could be the start of a trend this month if the ingredients all finally align.\n",
            "Hamas announced on Friday that among the three Israeli hostages to be released from Gaza on Saturday are an American dual national and the father of the youngest hostages taken from Israel on October 7, 2023. It named three men – Keith Siegel, Yarden Bibas and Ofer Kalderon as the captives that would be freed in the latest round. The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said their families had been informed. Siegel,an Israeli-American citizen, was taken from his home in kibbutz Kfar Aza. His wife Aviva, who was kidnapped alongside him, was released in November 2023 as part of the short-lived ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Bibas was kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz alongside his wife Shiri and two sons Kfir and Ariel. Kfir was just nine months when he was abducted, the youngest hostage taken on October 7. Hamas claimed in November 2023 that Shiri, Kfir and Ariel Bibas were killed in an Israeli airstrike, and released a hostage video of Yarden Bibas in which he blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for their deaths. An Israeli military spokesperson at the time called the video “psychological terror,” and Israel never confirmed their deaths, but the military has told relatives that they may not be alive, according to a spokesperson for the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Kalderon was 52 when he was kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz together with his son Erez, who was 11 at the time, and his daughter Sahar, who was 16. Erez and Sahar were also released during the November 2023 ceasefire. The Hostage and Missing Families Forum confirmed the names, and the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said that the families of the hostages have been informed. Hamas and allied militant groups have released 10 Israeli and five Thai hostages since a ceasefire went into effect on January 19. Chaotic scenes surrounding the release of Israeli and Thai hostages in Gaza on Thursdaybrought condemnationfrom Israeli leaders and a temporary delay in the release of Palestinian prisoners, who were ultimately released later in the day. Netanyahu described those scenes as “shocking,” and demanded guarantees from those who mediated a ceasefire deal – Qatar, Egypt and the United States – that the incident would not be repeated. Hamas is expected to release another 23 hostages over the course of the 42-day truce, including the three set for freedom this Saturday. Eight of them are dead, the Israeli government has confirmed. In exchange, Israel is releasinghundreds of Palestinian prisoners, some of whom have been held without charge, and others who have been convicted of the most serious offenses – 30 for every civilian, 50 for every Israeli soldier, and 110 for the nine hostages who are injured or sick and are not soldiers. On Saturday, Israel is expected to release 183 Palestinian prisoners, according to Hamas, 18 of whom are serving life sentences. As of Friday, Hamas and its allies were still holding 79 people taken from Israel on October 7, 2023, and three additional hostages who have been held captive since 2014. The Bibas family, and Kfir in particular, have become one of the most recognizable victims of the October 7 terror attacks. Kfir’s picture has been featured on many of the posters calling for the release of the hostages that have been on display across Israel and the world for the past 15 months. In it, thered-haired baby boyis holding a pink elephant toy, looking directly into the camera with a toothless smile. The two boys and their mother werenot released from Gazaduring the temporary truce in late November 2023, when many women and children were released. Shiri Bibas is one of four Israeli women still held in Gaza. The other three — Judi Weinstein Haggai, 70, Inbar Hayman, 27, and Ofra Keidar, 70 — are believed to be dead, according to the Israeli military. Kfir and Ariel Bibas are the the last remaining children in captivity. Both Siegel and Kalderon were kidnapped alongside some of their family members, several of whom have been released in November 2023 as part of the short-lived ceasefire deal. Their testimonies have provided a glimpse into the horrific realities faced by the hostages. Aviva Siegel said that while they were held captive together, Keith would ask everyone to identify one thing they were thankful for. “Imagine being in the depths of hell and still trying to find one thing each day that you are thankful for,” she said, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. A video of Siegel in captivity was released by Hamas in April last year. Speaking to CNN at that time,Aviva Siegel saidthat her husband looked pale and tired. “He’s 65 years old. He was taken from his house with Hamas terrorists in his pajamas, and he’s still there, underneath the ground,” she said. Siegel’s mother, Gladys Ruth Siegel, died in December aged 97, the family said. Kalderon has been described by his family as a keen cyclist and expert carpenter, and a man who enjoys music and field trips with his children. Israel has warned that if Saturday’s hostage release is as chaotic as Thursday’s then it will not open Gaza’s border crossing with Egypt, which it is supposed to do as part of the ceasefire agreement to allow sick and wounded militants and civilians to leave the enclave. An Israeli official told CNN Friday that the opening of the Rafah crossing was conditional on there not being a repeat of the scenes in which seven hostages were forced to walk through jeering Palestinian crowds during their release in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. “Israel sent a message (to the mediators) that if the images of Khan Younis will repeat themselves, the Rafah crossing will not open,” the official said. If everything goes smoothly during the handover of the three Israeli hostages, the crossing will open, the official said. Under the ceasefire agreement, up to 50 injured Palestinian militants in need of medical care will be allowed to cross into Egypt through Rafah per day. In addition to that, civilian Palestinian women and children who need medical care will also be allowed to cross to Egypt. Egyptian state-run media reported on Friday that the country had finished its preparations for opening the border crossing. The World Health Organization (WHO) has welcomed the opening of the border. “This will be the first medical evacuation since the ceasefire began, and the first time through Rafah since its closure in May 2024,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a post on X Friday. According to Ghebreyesus, between 12,000 and 14,000 people require “urgent specialized medical care outside Gaza.” The Rafah border crossing was overseen by Hamas between 2007 and 2024, after the group took full control of Gaza after winning elections in 2006. In May, Israeli forces took over the border following their military operations against Hamas in Gaza. More than 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage when Hamas militants launched an attack into Israel on October 7, 2023,according to Israeli authorities. Israel’s subsequent military offensive against Hamas in Gaza has killed at least 47,460 people and injured more than 111,000, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.

            "In the US, just19%of all venture capital (VC) investment partners — the people who write the cheques investing in entrepreneurs — are women; in Europe, a2023 reportfound that number to be 16%. That has a knock-on effect: women are more likely than mento invest in women-led enterprises, and US companies with onlyfemale founders saw just2%of all VC investment in 2022. According to theEuropean Investment Bank, female-founded companiesdeliver twice as much revenue per dollar invested, despite receiving less than half the investment capital of their male peers.Researchhas also consistently found that female investors are more interested in social impact businesses, which can benefit society more widely. In a bid to address the gender gap, AmandaPullinger founded Global Female Investors Management in 2024 with fellow finance industry veteran Vanessa Yuan. One of its core services is the Global Female Investors Network, a 2,000-strong community of women who manage money, whether it’s hedge funds, traditional funds or VC funds. After spending 25 years in finance, including over a decade as the CEO of 100 Women ​in Finance, a global non-profit professional association with over 30,000 registered ​members, Pullinger was ready for something different. Her mission has always been to address the under-representation of women in finance, but in theinvestment sector it was lacking more than any other. She spoke to CNN’s Bijan Hosseini at last week’s Global Labor Market Conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to discuss the barriers facing women in finance, and why more young women should join her network of “risk-takers.” This interview has been lightly edited for clarity. CNN: When it comes to women in leadership roles in investment, what are the biggest challenges? Amanda Pullinger (AP):I’d say the biggest challenge remains the fact that there are so few women in leadership roles. I’m a big believer in visibility. I grew up in the UK, and I was the first in my family to go to university. I went to Oxford because of a woman who was visible to me in a leadership role: Margaret Thatcher (the first British female prime minister). Like me, she was the first in her family to go to university, she went to Oxford. So I said to myself, “Well, she’s like me. If she can do it, I can do it.” While that sounds trite, most women want to be able to see a pathway into leadership. What’s the perception that you have ofan investor? It’s very often a White man, because that’s who we see on television or on panels at conferences. The reality is there are women in those roles, but we need them to be more visible. CNN: It almost feels like a chicken-and-egg situation. You need women visible in leadership roles to create an opportunity for more women in those leadership roles. So where do you start? AP:By introducing women to their peers. That’s why networks are so important. That network is important in sharing experiences because we can’t possibly know everything. The second step is to really get men on side. In my career, men have been massive advocates for me. Women don’t rush to do those panel discussions and be visible, but men can be helpful in saying, “I think it would be great for you to represent the organization,” and really push women into those roles and say, “Look, if you’re not comfortable, I’ll get you a communications coach. We’ll get you through some of the challenges that you may feel.” Men are such a critical part of getting to the solution. That’s why for me, sometimes when there’s discussion about DEI (Diversity, equity, and inclusion), I worry that men are excluded from that conversation. CNN: DEI has beena hot topicin the past couple weeks. We’ve seen the Trump administration come in and roll back a lot of DEI initiatives. Is that beneficial? Is that hurtful? AP:I’m a believer in meritocracy. I didn’t come from privilege: I made my own way, very much with the help of men in my career, but I made my own way. But here’s my big question to those who say, “Well, the world’s equal, and there are equal opportunities, so surely it should just be giving a job to the best person” — my challenge would be, how sure are you that you are giving access to the best person? I hear in the finance industry all the time from companies saying, “We don’t get any women applying for investment roles.” And I’m sitting here thinking, ‘I’ve got 2,000 members in our database who are female risk-takers.’ You are saying they’re not applying; there’s something missing here. I’m all about getting the best: but without some kind of action where you gain access to a broader range of people, you are potentially missing out on the best talent. It’s the same with female fund owners. I’m not saying they’re always the best, but if they’re excluded for all sorts of systemic reasons from the process, again, I’d ask allocators: how do you know you’re picking the best fund? It’s very much around creating access and opportunity, and then things can fall where they fall. But without that access and opportunity, I don’t think the world is getting the best talent. CNN: Is there any kind of emphasis that should be placed on education, or is it beyond that? AP:What’s really fascinating is we are now in a place in the world where I believe, globally, there are more women going through universities, proportional to men. But actually, the big issue I find with most professional women who are well-educated is that we’ve all been told that if we work hard and we perform, we’ll be noticed, we’ll be promoted, we’ll be acknowledged. That works while you are in full-time education because full-time education is about working hard, doing a test and getting a result. The reality is when you come into the business world, it’s about relationships. So the advice I give to women is to spend a little bit less time focused on hunkering down doing the work, and do what the guys do: build relationships, take the time for yourself, get yourself on conference panels, put your hand up, be vocal. All those things, to some extent, take away from this notion that it’s all about hard work — of course it’s about hard work, but women have got to learn that it’s also about relationships. We’ve never been taught that, and it’s something that I say all the time to women. CNN: You mentioned the need to get more young female risk-takers involved. What’s your advice to them? AP:I wish when I was younger, someone had said to me, “Do not give up maths at 16.” I should have done maths at A-level (a pre-university school qualification in England, Wales and Northern Ireland), I was perfectly capable of doing it. So I think first of all, it’s about giving women the fundamental skill set and confidence in numbers. The second is, I wish that more young women knew the impact you can have in the world by becoming a capital allocator or an investment professional. If you want to create change in the world, managing money is one of the best ways to do it, because you can guide where that money goes, and that money can have an impact. This is not just a greedy industry, it’s a place where you truly can make a difference in the world. That’s something I wish more young women knew.\n",
            "Rwandan President Paul Kagame has told CNN he doesn’t know if his country’s troops are in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where fighting between the M23 armed group and Congolese soldiers has killed more than 900 people and injured thousands in recent days. Much of the international community believes that Rwanda backs the M23 rebels, who claimed to capture the city of Goma in eastern Congo last week. UN experts believe that anestimated 3,000 - 4,000 Rwandan soldiersare supervising and supporting M23 fighters in the east of the DRC, outnumbering the rebel group’s forces in the country. In an exclusive interview with CNN on Monday, Kagame was asked if there were any Rwandan troops inside the DRC. “I don’t know,” Kagame said, despite the fact that he is commander-in-chief of the Rwandan Defence Force. “There are many things I don’t know. But if you want to ask me, is there a problem in Congo that concerns Rwanda? And that Rwanda would do anything to protect itself? I’d say 100%,” he continued. At least 900 bodies have been recovered from the streets of Goma since violence erupted, according to the United Nations’ latest figures. “As of 31 January, at least 900 bodies have been recovered from the streets,” said the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in a report Monday, citing the World Health Organization. Kagame’s stance was reiterated by the rebel group, whose spokesperson Victor Tesongo told CNN that it “receives no support from Rwanda,” describing the assumption as “a manipulation of public opinion to disqualify us.” Tesongo claimed that Rwanda was more concerned about “its fight against the FDLR (Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda) which are allied to the Congolese government which uses them against the security of Rwanda.” DRC communications minister, Patrick Muyaya, told CNN Monday that Rwanda’s military presence in his country was well documented, saying, “Kagame is the only voice denying this.” “In the past 10 days, the UN Group of Experts, the UN Security Council, the UN Secretary-General, President João Lourenço (of Angola), and SADC (the Southern African Development Community) have all confirmed Rwanda’s military presence in eastern DRC. Kagame is the only voice denying this,” Muyaya said in his response to Kagame’s CNN interview, adding that “the overwhelming international consensus leaves no doubt.” CNN’s Larry Madowo told Kagame that comparisons have been made between him and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who backed local separatist forces to try and invade Donbas, an eastern region of Ukraine, in 2014. “There will be so many stories,” Kagame said of the comparison, adding that he can’t “stop people from saying whatever they want to say.” “I may be called anything - what can I do about it?” he asked. “We have to do what we have to do… we have to make sure we survive any storm that blows across our country.” Kagame called the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), one of the largest foreign armed groups operating in the DRC, an “existential threat” to Rwanda. He alleged that the group was fully integrated into the Congolese armed forces, suggesting that other governments in the region also support the rebel group. Kagame repeatedly insisted that Rwanda will do “whatever it takes” to protect itself, without giving much information about what this entails. “Nobody,” including the United Nations or the international community “is going to do it for us,” the leader said. When asked again if he was sending troops to the DRC, Kagame said that Rwanda will do “anything to protect itself,” telling Madowo to “read whatever you want to read from what I’m telling you.” The simmering conflict between Rwanda and the DRC, which share a border, has since exploded following the M23’s advance into Goma. Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolo told CNN that, as of Monday, 16 people have been killed in Rwanda “during the shelling from the fighting in Goma.” Last week, DRC leader Felix Tshisekedi vowed “a vigorous and coordinated response” against M23, describing the group as Rwanda’s “puppet.” The rebel alliance told CNN it was working to “install a new administration” in Goma and would march on to capture more territories, including the neighboring South Kivu province and the national capital Kinshasa. “Effectively our struggle cannot be limited to Goma, the objective remains to overthrow Tshisekedi and to install a new leadership capable of finding solutions to the problems faced by our people,” its spokesperson Tesongo said.\n",
            "As Germany enters the final few weeks of its election campaign, the man poised to be the next chancellor has doubled down on tightening the country’s immigration policy — shifting the nation to the right. Speaking to CNN in Berlin following his Christian Democratic Party’s (CDU) convention, Friedrich Merz said he would “control [Germany’s] borders and return those who are coming without documents,” if elected. Merz and the Union party, comprised of the CDU and their Bavarian sister party the CSU, lead the polls with 30% of the vote. Last week, Merz, a former investment banker at BlackRock with a pilot’s license, also made migration the focus of his campaign. The German lawmaker brought forward two pieces of legislation severely curbing migration. While the non-binding bill passed by a small majority, the binding “Influx Limitation Act” failed. Ahead of that Friday vote Merz told fellow parliamentarians, “the door to hell, we can still close together”. Notably, among those who voted against the bill, were members of Merz’s own party. Germany has seen a spate of recent attacks perpetrated by migrants that has catapulted the issue to the center of the election campaign. In January anattack in Aschaffenburgleft two people dead, including a two-year old boy. The attacker was an Afghan migrant. Just before Christmas six people werekilled in Magdeburgafter a Saudi-origin migrant drove a car through a Christmas market. Merz dismissed his party’s role in the bill’s failure. Instead, he looked to deflect the blame on to the ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD), headed by current chancellor Olaf Scholz. “This legislation was something which we had agreed with the Social Democrats before in our government in 2018. This is something which they had laid down in their election program,” he told CNN. “So in my view, they could have agreed with what we proposed. And my guess is that they will do so after the election”. But that does not tell the whole story of a tumultuous week for Merz. There is an unwritten agreement between Germany’s largest parties that they would never seek the support of thefar-right Alternative for Germany (AfD)to pass laws or legislation – it’s known as the firewall. Working with the far-right is a taboo in German politics. Last week Merz made it clear that he did not mind if the AfD voted for his proposals on curbing migration. The far-right party voted on both pieces of legislation Merz proposed, helping push the non-binding bill over the line, a risky gambit that prompted hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets. But Merz reiterated to CNN that working with the AfD was a non-starter. “They are against… everything [that] we are, what we build up in the Federal Republic of Germany. There is no co-operation with this party”, he told CNN. On the issue ofElon Musk,who has become a feature of this election cycle, Merz said “I don’t appreciate what he is doing, but he is doing something which he is free to do”.  Musk has beencontroversially insertinghimself into the German election campaign in favor of the AfD. Taking note of US President Donald Trump’s economic measures against some of the US’s closest allies, Merz was clear that any tariffs placed on the European Union would be handled at “the European level”. The United States is the European Union second largest trading partner, according to US trade data. On Sunday President Trump called the European Union an “atrocity” that would also be facing tariffs, saying the bloc was “taking advantage” of the United States. Anecdotally, Merz told CNN that during Trump’s first term in the White House the EU brokered a deal that led to tariffs ending six weeks later. The likely future chancellor has also been a staunch supporter of Ukraine and has vowed his continued support. “We are on the Ukrainian side because the attack is against all of us,” he told CNN, while also urging that Germany keep meeting its NATO pledge to spend 2% of GDP on defense, another Trump bugbear. On the issue of ending the war, something which President Trump vowed to do within 24 hours after he assumed office, Merz said it would be best to cooperate with the US. He was eager however, to hear the plans from the horse’s mouth: “we do not yet know what they are really planning to do. I would like to see what they are planning to do”. Crucially for Merz, he may not have to wait much longer.\n",
            "The mayor of Jenin, in the occupied West Bank, told CNN on Monday that the Israeli assault on the Jenin Refugee Camp was akin to the war in Gaza, saying it had destroyed 120 buildings and displaced 15,000 people. “What has been happening in Jenin city and the refugee camp over the past two weeks is similar to that of Gaza but on a smaller scale,” Mohammad Jarrar said Monday. Hundreds of residential units make up the 120 destroyed buildings, he said, noting that the destruction had impacted thousands of families. Jarrar described scenes of devastation amid a shortage of food, water and medication as services have been disrupted because of the operation. He added that displacement is expected to only further increase. Israel launched its operation two days after the first stage of the Gaza ceasefire began, dubbing it “Operation Iron Wall.” The Israeli military said the operation was aimed at eliminating “terrorists and terror infrastructure” and “ensuring that terrorism does not return to the camp after the operation is over – the first lesson from the method of repeated raids in Gaza.” More than 40 Palestinians have been killed across the West Bank by the Israeli military since the operation was launched, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, which said that 25 of those people were from Jenin. Dozens more have been injured, the ministry said. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right nationalist who opposes the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, said in a January statement that security in the West Bank had been added to the country’s “war goals.” Smotrich publicly toyed with quitting the Israeli government when the Gaza ceasefire was announced, but decided to stay in the cabinet after saying he had received assurances from Netanyahu on his commitment to continue Israel’s military operations in the West Bank and Gaza. Jarrar told CNN that the military operation on Jenin was “political,” noting the desire of some in Israeli government to annex the West Bank and encourage Palestinians to emigrate from the territory. The mayor said that schools might be opened to take in displaced people, as was seen in Gaza over the 15-month-long war. “Today the (Jenin) camp is uninhabitable and would require major reconstruction efforts for it to stand on its feet,” he said, adding that the “crisis is huge,” and that alternative housing for the displaced might be needed for around six months. Last week, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Israeli troops would remain in the Jenin camp once their current operation is complete – a significant change in Israeli policy. Jenin’s mayor told CNN that the minister’s statement is “worrying” and raises “many questions about the future of the West Bank, not just Jenin and its camp.” Meanwhile, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), said in a statement Monday that “Jenin camp has been rendered a ghost town.” “Operations conducted both by Israeli and Palestinian security forces have led to the forced displacement of thousands of camp residents, many of whom will now have nowhere to return to. The basics of life are gone,” it said. “Today’s shocking scenes in the West Bank undermine the fragile ceasefire reached in Gaza, and risk a new escalation,” the UNRWA statement added.\n",
            "Security officials confiscating bottles of water, tubes of shower gel and pots of face creams are a common sight at airport security. But officials enforcing the no-liquids rule at South Korea’s Incheon International Airport have been busy seizing another outlawed item:kimchi, a concoction of salted and fermented vegetables that is a staple of every Korean dinner table. Last year, officials atIncheon International Airport(ICN)confiscated a total of 10.7 tons of the country’s must-have side dish from passengers violating the ban on liquid in carry-on luggage, according to the airport. That’s because pre-packaged kimchi often comes in a bottle or plastic bag and is soaked in spicy sauce, meaning it counts as a liquid. Like many other airports around the world, authorities at ICN ban liquids and gels exceeding 100ml in carry-on luggage. Across 2023, the airport officials say they also confiscated 10.5 tons ofjang, a word covering a wide range of traditional fermented sauces and pastes. One YouTube video posted last year by a popular Korean travel influencer reminding travelers that kimchi was check-in-only has racked up 1.2 million views. The confiscated food items are either thrown away or donated to a local community welfare center along with other confiscated items, according to airport officials. And this isn’t the first time that Korean officials have taken a strong stance on a popular food product. In 2024, Korean Air, the country’s flagship airline, announced that it wouldno longer serve ramyeon instant noodlesto passengers traveling in economy on long-haul flights. The airline cited “the increasing trend of turbulence” making it too dangerous to serve the snack –- which is made by adding boiling water. In addition, travelers bringing Trader Joe’s Everything But the Bagel mix into South Korea reported running afoul of authorities. The product, which is only sold in the United States, has gone viral on TikTok and is a popular “souvenir” for travelers who are returning from America. The popular seasoning mixwas deemed illegalbecause it contains poppy seeds, an oilseed banned in Korea. One South Korean blogger reported that she brought back 20 bottles of the seasoning upon returning home from a visit to the US. However, she said, the bottles came out of the luggage conveyer belt with a yellow lock on them and were later confiscated by officials. Now, signs in Korean and English have been placed throughout the terminal warning travelers against trying to bring Everything But the Bagel seasoning mixes into the country.\n",
            "Two new 591-foot-tall skyscrapers, linked across the top by a daring “sky pool,” are set to rise above Dubai’s Marasi Marina. But the soaring 43-foot infinity pool will not be accessible to the public, or even to most of the luxury towers’ residents — it’s part of what its architectsdescribeas an exclusive “ultra-penthouse.” Comprising 63 luxury residences, the new Regent Residences Dubai will be worth an estimated $1 billion upon its completion in 2027. The 35,000-square-foot penthouse features six bedrooms, a gym and a private elevator. The project’s other apartments, which all measure upwards of 6,500 square feet, will each occupy an entire floor. They were orientated to offer views of the marina and the nearbyBurj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building. And residents need not worry about missing out on the “sky pool”: All the apartments contain their own private swimming terraces (and access to another 82-foot indoor lap pool). A series of newly released renderings show the staggered pool terraces jutting out from the two towers’ facades. The design was “inspired by cascading water,” according to Foster + Partners, the architecture firm behind the project. Real estate company Sankari (which developed the project alongside IHG Hotels & Resorts)  declined to disclose to CNN how much the “ultra-penthouse” will cost, though the other residences start at $10 million each. Advertised as the “jewel in Dubai’s crown,” the luxury development also features 10 floating homes dubbed “water villas.” Residents will enjoy access to tennis and padel courts, outdoor lounges, a private cinema and virtual golf simulator, among much else. The podium at the base of the towers will meanwhile feature open green spaces, restaurants and retail space. The project is part of a majoroverhaulof the waterfront Marasi Marina neighborhood in Business Bay, a new high-rise development on the Dubai Creek, south of the city’s downtown area. It is Regent Residences’ first property in the Middle East. The two towers are not identical though they share “same design language,” according to Foster + Partners. In a press statement, the firm’s studio head Gerard Evenden said the project’s “dynamic twisting form and articulated facade” will make it “a distinctive new addition” to Dubai. Foster + Partners, which was founded by the celebrated architect — and winner of the Pritzker Prize, the profession’s equivalent to a Nobel —Norman Foster, has designed numerous other high-profile buildings in the United Arab Emirates in recent years. Among them are an 80-story Dubai skyscraper, called The Index, and the House of Wisdom, a library and culture center in Sharjah. The firm’s sculptural Zayed National Museum, which will serve as the centerpiece of Abu Dhabi’s new Saadiyat Island Cultural District, is due to open later this year. It is not the first time a swimming pool has been suspended between buildings:London’s see-through Sky Pool,built across the 10th stories of two residential towers, opened in the British capital’s Nine Elms neighborhood in 2021.\n",
            "A major winter stormslammed the US Gulf CoastTuesday, blanketing parts of a region largely unaccustomed to extreme winter weather with record-breaking snowfall. The storm impacted 1,500 miles of the Deep South from the Texas Gulf Coast to the Atlantic coast of the Carolinas, causing widespread closures and travel disruptions, including stranded motorists and thousands of canceled flights. The storm, along with the brutal cold that helped cause it, is blamed for at least 11 deaths. The snowfall that dazzled Southerners unaccustomed to significant accumulation is over, but the cold is sticking around and keeping slippery conditions in place. Many cities are begging residents to avoid driving as the sun melts snow that then refreezes, increasing the danger on roadways. In New Orleans, which saw record snowfall and frigid temperatures, Mayor LaToya Cantrell said Wednesday the city is focusing on response and recovery. “The city has been through challenging situations before,” Cantrell said. “Through the dedication and tireless efforts of our people, we will get through this history snow event.” City crews in New Orleans are working to clear bridges and roads while warning residents should still shelter in place. Multiple locations in Florida recorded enough snow to preliminarily shatter the state’s all-time snowfall record of 4 inches set in 1954. More than a foot of snow fell in Louisiana, the high mark from the storm. New Orleans shattered its modern all-time daily snowfall record on Tuesday, receiving 8 inches of snow, far surpassing the previous record of 2.7 inches. The city has recorded more snowfall this month than Anchorage, Alaska, which has seen nearly two inches in January. The Big Easy typically sees measurable snow only about once per decade. Other Southern cities also broke long-standing snowfall records: The Mobile Civic Center roof collapsed under the weight of heavy snow Wednesday morning. “The collapse occurred in a manner consistent with the plans for the building’s ongoing demolition,” the city said in a social media post. No one was injured. Nationwide, at least 11 deaths have been reported due to the severe cold affecting large parts of the country and the winter storm. On Tuesday, at least five people died in a vehicle accident caused by icy conditions in Zavala County, Texas, Sheriff Eusevio Salinas told CNN. Four of the victims were ejected from their vehicle as it wrecked on a bridge. Wednesday morning, a woman was also killed when a minivan she was in collided with a tractor-trailer on US Highway 57 east of La Pryor, Texas, Salinas said. A 27-year-old woman died in Ozark, Alabama, after her car slid on a snow-covered highway Tuesday and hit a pickup truck head-on after crossing the center line, according to the Dale County Coroner’s Office and Ozark Police Department. Authorities are also investigating two deaths in Austin as potentially cold-related, though the medical examiner’s office has not confirmed the causes. In Georgia, officials reported one hypothermia-related death, noting the individual had been outside the previous night. While the wintry storm has had a visceral impact on the Gulf region, below-freezing temperatures are also affecting much of the US. An 80-year-old man in Milwaukee is suspected to have died from hypothermia after falling outdoors early Sunday, according to the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office. Below-freezing weather helped law enforcement in Oklahoma catch a fugitive. A man accused of slamming a vehicle into a Pottawatomie County Sheriff’s deputy’s cruiser during a pursuit and then leading authorities on a foot chase was caught less than three hours later,according to the sheriff’s office. The chase ended after the suspect entered a stranger’s home and asked them to call the sheriff because he had decided it was too cold to stay on the run, the sheriff’s officetold CNN affiliate KOCO. As temperatures plunged below freezing this week, the plight of those experiencing homelessness became increasingly dire. In San Antonio, Mariah Pena and Daniel Vertiz felt the weight of this reality when Pena found a woman seeking refuge in their dog kennel on the porch Sunday,CNN affiliate KSAT reported. Startled yet desperate, the woman explained that she had nowhere else to turn. Though the couple hesitated to invite a stranger into their home, they felt an imperative to help, thinking that even a makeshift shelter would offer respite from the life-threatening cold. “Who knows what could have happened if she were left out on the streets?” Vertiz told the outlet. There were about 1,300 people using warming shelters in Houston Wednesday morning, Mary Benton with the Houston mayor’s office told CNN. The two largest centers were filled, but Houston Mayor John Whitmire said no one was turned away. “There’s no such thing in weather like this as reaching capacity,” Whitmire said Wednesday. Two warming centers in New Orleans quickly reached capacity on Wednesday causing the city to open a third. Mobile Crisis Units and the health department are working to transport people to the newly opened center, a city spokesperson said. Airports in Alabama, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida closed Tuesday due to unprecedented snowfall. Issues from the closures rippled into Wednesday. More than 1,800flights have been canceled nationwide as of Wednesday afternoon, primarily affecting routes to and from Texas and Louisiana along with Atlanta, the nation’s busiest airport,according to FlightAware. In Mississippi,Gulfport-Biloxi International Airportclosed its terminal and runway until conditions improved.Jacksonville International Airportreopened at noon on Wednesday, while Tallahassee International, Mobile Regional and Mobile International Airports will remain closed until midday Thursday, due to “ongoing weather conditions,” Wednesday updates said.Lafayette Regional Airportin Louisiana also remained shut down due to icy conditions. All departing flights atLouis Armstrong New Orleans International Airportwere canceled Wednesday, but flights resumed at both ofHouston’s major airports, George Bush Intercontinental and Hobby. With cold weather conditions across the region this week, roads could remain hazardous as snow melts and refreezes. In Louisiana, Interstate 10 from the Louisiana/Texas state line to Baton Rouge – a roughly 150-mile stretch – was closed in both directions due to “deteriorating road conditions” Wednesday,according to the state Department of Transportation and Development. Nearly 30 state roadways were closed as of Tuesday, including the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway – the nation’s longest bridge over water. To help treat roads, New Orleans has hired 14 snow plows from an Indiana-based company, Collin Arnold, the city director of homeland security and emergency preparedness, told reporters Tuesday. The initial focus will be on clearing critical routes, while crews will tackle main thoroughfares, he said. Meanwhile, roads in Alabama’sEscambia,MobileandBaldwincounties were deemed “impassable” and closed due to the storm’s impact, officials said. Nineteen counties in Mississippi were still reporting ice on roads and bridges Wednesday morning, with black ice remaining a significant threat, the Mississippi Department of Transportationsaid on social media.“Until the sun warms us up enough to thaw things down today, please only drive if it’s an emergency!” The Georgia State Patrol responded to more than 100 vehicle crashes in a 14-hour period, theDepartment of Public Safety said. Metro-Atlanta’s DeKalb County declared a state of emergency Wednesday morning after “hundreds” of 911 calls and over 100 vehicles became stranded on icy roadways, with many obstructing emergency response efforts. “This is a highly unusual winter weather event impacting nearly three-quarters of the state and our crews cannot be everywhere at once,” Georgia DOT Commissioner Russell McMurry said. “Georgia DOT will need time, ability to access the roads to treat or plow, and warmer temperatures working in our favor to help restore and maintain passable conditions.”\n",
            "TheGrammy Awardsare renowned for outlandish fashion. But on a night of tributes to first responders and victims of LA’s recent wildfires, many guests struck a comparatively restrained note at the Crypto.com arena on Sunday. The all-black trend seen at recent award ceremonies was embraced by everyone from Miley Cyrus (in a cut-out leather Saint Laurent dress) to Olivia Rodrigo (in a slinky halter neck Versace number). Lady Gaga set a somber tone in a dramatic long-sleeved ball gown by Vivienne Westwood, though some attendees took a more light-hearted approach, whether it was J Balvin’s long silk Dior Men coat or the sailor hat Billie Eilish wore with her Prada suit. Guests also showed their support for LA — which has hosted the Grammys more times than any other city in its 66-year history — by wearing blue heart pins. Brittany Howard, Jaden Smith and Jacob Collier were among those seen sporting the pins in support of MusiCares, a charity raising money for music industry professionals impacted by the fires. Elsewhere, several of the evening’s most anticipated arrivals used feathers to add volume or definition to their outfits. Sabrina Carpenter wowed in a custom JW Anderson gown with elegant accents, while the beads and sequins of Cardi B’s Roberto Cavalli Couture mermaid gown turned into an autumnal plume as it trailed to the floor. Meanwhile, Charli XCX and Chappell Roan, who were among the night’s most nominated artists, achieved similarly eye-catching effects with ruffles and cascading tulle. It was perhaps no surprise that both gowns were by the same designer, Jean Paul Gaultier, albeit from very different eras: Charli XCX’s outfit was a custom look from the Spring-Summer 2025 runway, while Roan opted for an archive piece from Gaultier’s Spring 2003 couture collection. And this wouldn’t be the Grammy’s without a bit of skin — or the illusion of it. The various takes on nude ranged from the subtle (see Madison Beer’s divine strapless gown and the sheer detailing of Shakira’s Etro dress) to the not-so-subtle. Ye’s wife Bianca Censori left little to the imagination, shocking onlookers by dropping her coat to reveal a see-through slip dress that was, in every sense, barely there. See below for some of the event’s best and boldest looks. This story will be updated throughout the evening.\n",
            "Nigerian Afro-pop sensation Yemi Alade has history with the Grammys. She’s featured on a Grammy-nominated album by Beyoncé and a Grammy-winning one by Beninese-French star Angelique Kidjo; but despite her popularity in Africa and her multilingual songs, Alade has yet to win a solo Grammy. On February 2, that could change, with her song “Tomorrow” nominated in the Best African Music Performance category. For Alade, her latest nomination is particularly special. “This time around it was for my own song, it was for my own crown,” she told CNN. “Tomorrow” features on Alade’s sixth studio album “Rebel Queen,” which theRecording Academy said “solidifies her reputation as “Mama Africa”—the title of a previous Alade album and a term associated with iconic South African singer Miriam Makeba. Alade first found fame with her 2014 single “Johnny,” which in 2019 made her the first Nigerian female artist to hit100 million viewson YouTube. She has also recorded the song in Portuguese, Swahili, and French. She was inspired to record the French version by hearing her francophone African fans singing it word for word at her shows and thought that would show them her appreciation. As she began to tour Europe, she recalls the song became one of the pillars of her career. “Paris is one of the cities that opened its borders to my music, and I fell in love with French even more,” Alade told CNN. “I wanted to communicate, so I decided to make versions of my songs (in other languages). That’s how the love story with languages started off.” Alade was born in Abia State, southeastern Nigeria, to a Yoruba father and an Igbo mother, and historically, “intertribal relationships were frowned on,” she explained. As a teen growing up in Lagos, she and her friends were also immersed in African American culture listening to rap music and making mix tapes. That context played a key role in Alade’s development as an artist and intentionality became paramount, from her lyrics to her album titles. “King of Queens,” “Woman of Steel,” “Mama Africa,” “Empress”, and “Rebel Queen” all speak of her struggles as a female artist in the industry, women’s empowerment and the unification of Africans across the world. “I needed to be my own superwoman. I think that spirit became what you see today,” she said. Rebel Queen mixes genres like R&B and pop with dancehall, highlife, and amapiano, with Alade singing in English, French, Igbo, Yoruba, and Swahili. It is the climax of a decade-long musical career that has taken her on a rich cultural journey. “My love for Africa just genuinely grows,” she said. “I do not do this with an agenda. When I travel, I see the different cultures, I easily accept it, appreciate it, from the food to the language to the way of life. In every country I go to there’s something that’s culturally appealing.” Alade has become known as a champion of African culture and for her international collaborations. Shefeatured in Beyoncé’s2020 musical film and visual album “Black is King,” and on her song “Don’t Jealous Me” from the album “The Lion King: The Gift.” New album “Rebel Queen” features Ziggy Marley on the song “Peace and Love” and Kidjo on “African Woman.” The latter, Alade says, was one of the most challenging and fulfilling songs to make because she got to know one of her heroes even better, describing Kidjo as “my musical mother.” Despite her growing success, Alade has chosen to remain independent, working with the same management team for over a decade in the music industry and recording with Effyzzie Music Group, rather than a major label. “Other labels have made offers and we haven’t accepted, not because they’re not good enough. (But) if your goals are not in alignment with the goals that I’ve set for myself for over 10 years, then we should not be in the same boat. If you have a team of two people, trust me, that’s all you need,” she added.\n",
            "Japanese authorities haveasked hundreds of residents near Tokyo to evacuate as asinkholeat an intersection grew to more than 40 meters wide, hampering rescuers racing to reach an elderly truck driver whose vehicle was swallowed by the hole. On Tuesday, part of a road intersection in Saitama prefecture, about 18 miles north ofJapan’s capital, opened up, swallowing a three-ton truck and its driver, a 74-year-old man, prompting a rescue mission now in its fourth day. The pit has expanded to 40 meters wide – four times its width when it first appeared, a local official told CNN on Friday. “The inside is gouging and it’s getting bigger every day,” the official from Saitama Prefecture’s Sewerage Works Division said. Rescuers have used cranes to lift part of the truck out of the hole and have sent drones underground but have not been able to communicate with the truck driver since Tuesday. Authorities believe that corroded sewer pipes may have caused the earth to fall in. Leaking wastewater may have further eroded the surrounding soil, widening the chasm, they said. Two hundred households have been asked to evacuate from the areasince Tuesday, local authorities said. Local authorities also asked 1.2 million residents to refrain from bathing and doing laundry in a bid to cut down on wastewater, which could further complicate rescue efforts in the fragile area. Thesudden opening of the earth has sparked fears among somein the densely-populated region about the labyrinth of ageing pipes beneath their homes and businesses. “I live close to the area, and I’ve been watching all the news footage. The moment the hole widens was really scary,” said oneuser on the social media platform, X. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism told CNN Friday that it has ordered emergency inspections of similar sewer pipes across Saitama and six other prefectures, home to around 39 million people. Sinkholes are most common in areas underlain by rocks like gypsum, limestone and other carbonate rocks, which can be naturally dissolved by groundwater, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Much of the state ofFloridais underlain by limestone, making it extremely susceptible to the phenomena, USGS noted. Takashi Oguchi, a geographer﻿ from the University of Tokyo, said sinkholes are rare in Japan, where most roads are built on unconsolidated fluvial and marine sediments. But he warned that when a large underground waterpipe ruptures, leaked water could wash away these sediments, creating a sinkhole. Much of Japan’s public infrastructure was built between the 1960s and 1970s during an economic boom in the wake of World War II, during which much of Tokyo was destroyed by American bombing raids. The sewage system in question in the Saitama prefecture is about 42 years old. “We will have such events more in the future because the decay of underground pipes is ongoing little by little, and many pipes are located below roads,” Oguchi said. Reiko Kuwano,a civil engineering professorfrom Tokyo University, said inspecting pipes buried deep underground is always a challenge. At the traffic intersection in Saitama on Friday, rescuers raced to reach the driver trapped for days meters below the tarmac. The mission has proven difficult so far, the official from Sewerage Works Division told CNN. He said the original hole that brought down the driver had merged witha secondsinkholenearby, resulting in the expansion of the sinkhole. The driver was “buried in earth and sand, and if we bring heavy equipment near the asphalt it might fall in,” he said. He said rescue workers are planning to build a ramp to bring the heavy equipment from an angle. “We’re working hard building the ramp and aiming to get it built by today,” he said.\n",
            "The year is 1984. It’sSuper BowlSunday and you turn on the TV to see a procession of stern men marching through a tunnel. No, it’s not the Los AngelesRaiders. It’s the most important Super Bowl commercial of all time. Apple’s iconicMacintosh advert, simply called “1984” and based on George’s Orwell’s novel of the same name, featured a “Big Brother” figure addressing hordes of subjects from a giant screen and a woman who escapes riot police to smash the screen with a hammer. When viewed now, it is the epitome of the 1980s – CRT TVs, dramatic voiceovers and big hair. But back then, it was unlike any commercial America had ever seen. “They sold $150 million worth of computers in 100 days,” says David Stubley – sports marketing expert and author ofGamechangers and Rainmakers: How Sport Became Big Business– in an interview withCNN Sport. “The whole ad industry just stopped in their tracks and went: ‘What just happened? How did that happen?’” It might be hard to believe, but the Super Bowl was not always such a big deal. Long before Taylor Swift or the invention of the jumbotron, Super Bowl I was won, fairly comfortably, by the 1967 Green Bay Packers. If you were one of the24 millionpeople watching at home, you would have seenhalftime commercialsfrom the likes of Goodyear, McDonald’s and Tang, each of whom would have paid a reported $38,000 for the slot – about $350,000 when adjusted for inflation. By 1984, Stubley estimates that companies were forking out around $300,000, or $900,000 adjusted. That’s a sizeable amount, until you consider that the NFL is now selling some 30-second slots for$8 million. It would be disingenuous to claim that “1984” is the sole reason for Super Bowl commercials now releasing with the fanfare that they do. But, as Stubley explains, there is a noticeable “before and after” effect around the iconic commercial. “Advertising before that time was either cheesy, personality driven, or what I would describe as transactional – ‘Here it is, do you want it?’” he explains. “What this ad did, it basically said: ‘Forget everything that’s happened in the past. And the only way to do that is to smash that hammer through that big screen.’” It is perhaps no surprise that the commercial was so cinematic, given who directed it. Ridley Scott had enjoyed so much success with “Alien” and “Blade Runner” by that point that many did not realize the Englishman had actually started his career in the advertising industry. His signature dystopian style lent itself perfectly to Orwell’s story. “We were all so scared about 1984, so it tapped into that brilliantly,” says Stubley. “Everyone thought the world was going to come to an end in 1984, if you’d read George Orwell’s book. And so to have this take on that whole scariness and confront it in such a brilliant way, I think it really caught people’s imagination.” Despite the Macintosh computer never actually featuring in the commercial itself, it is hard not hard to infer that “Big Brother” represented the existing tech companies. “The juxtaposition between the alternative of IBM and HP and Dell and this was probably what made it so exciting for everybody. It’s a bit like the Air Jordans 10 years later. You know, sticking two fingers up to the establishment,” explains Stubley. “Steve Jobs, if you look at any of his talks from that era, he openly stokes that. He says: ‘All these suits who just crank out vanilla hardware and vanilla software, there’s got to be a better way, surely.’ He was very good at saying: ‘That’s the establishment, that’s traditional. We’re nothing to do with that.’” Handily for Apple, the 1980s were not only defined by Orwellian anxiety. They were also a decade when advertisers started to devote real attention – and budget – to the power of the little box in everyone’s living room. “TV advertising at that time suddenly blew up. All these new categories suddenly discovered it,” says Stubley. “In America, there was this huge war between Miller and Budweiser. Then you had finance suddenly discovering the power of TV, retail discovering the power of TV. So all of these categories were all kind of piling in.” It meant Apple were able to spend the kind of money – estimated by Stubley to be around $600,000 ($1.8 million when adjusted for inflation) – that was required for what was essentially a 60-second blockbuster. Of course, you can spend all the money you want on the perfect Super Bowl commercial, but if everyone the next day is talking about the game itself, then the effects will be limited. Luckily for Steve Jobs and co., that was not the case. With the Raiders up 21-3 on the then-named Washington Redskins at halftime, the contest was essentially over. “All the action was taking place in the ad break, not on the pitch,” says Stubley. “You’re sitting there, it’s a dull game, you know what’s going to happen. You’ve got your beer, you’ve got your burger. You’re sitting through traditional advertising – Taco Bell, Walmart, whatever. “And then suddenly, boom! This thing comes into your living room. It must have been shocking.” The success of the Macintosh commercial, according to Stubley, prompted other companies to spend bigger on their own Super Bowl advertising. “Post-1984 there was a lot of money to go around,” he says. “And so if you want to build rapid brand awareness (and) you’ve got a $400 million ad budget, as Budweiser would have had in the 90s, and you want to put Miller Light back in its box … you just buy up the ad breaks in the Super Bowl.” Even now, when Super Bowl commercials come with a price tag of $8 million, Stubley still believes they can be a worthwhile investment. “If you’re looking to build brand awareness amongst American adults aged 35 and under, the Super Bowl is one of the quickest ways of doing it, if not exactly the cheapest,” he explains. But the halftime advertising landscape after the Apple commercial was not just defined by its ever-increasing budgets. Companies also borrowed stylistically from the way Apple approached the task. Nowadays, more than 40 years later, it is not hard to see the ripples left by “1984.” Big-name directors routinely trade Hollywood for the Super Bowl, with the likes of Martin Scorsese, David Fincher and Zack Snyder all contributing commercials in recent years. In fact, many halftime commercials are now mini movies in themselves, with A-list actors, storylines, and even teaser trailers released ahead of time. Many tune in just to watch the adverts, such is their cultural importance. In the streaming age, when many people can watch anything at any time, live sports remain as one of the few ways advertisers can create watercooler moments. “In today’s fragmented world, to still be able to get 120 million Americans – that’s not even the global audience – to sit in front of something, it’s quite breathtaking,” says Stubley. “This is the biggest event in the advertising calendar, period.” This year, when you watch Kendrick Lamar perform in the halftime show, it will likely be accompanied by a small Apple logo in the bottom-right corner – a privilege the tech giant paid $50 million for. And if you find yourself laughing, or texting a friend, or just thinking about about any of the commercials you see this Sunday, spare a thought for “1984.” They might not exist without it.\n",
            "Ed Nordskog never wanted to work on arson; his heart was set on becoming a homicide detective. But when an arson investigator position came up in the LA County Sheriff’s Department, the money was good and he took it. He quickly found himself completely sucked in. “It fascinated me, the arsonists were truly really odd criminals,” he told CNN. He spent the next two decades immersed in their world. In retirementhe has found his expert insight into the minds of arsonists in high demand due to a string of arson arrests in the wake of thedeadly Los Angeles fires. While the fires’ causes are still being investigated — and experts, including Nordskog, believe arson is highly unlikely to be behind the biggest blazes — the arrests have put a spotlight on the question of why people deliberately set fires. It turns out it’s a very tough one to answer. There is no such thing as a typical arsonist; anybody and everybody commits arson for a slew of different reasons, Nordskog said. “It’s a very odd crime that just a few people understand.” Psychologists point to some common characteristics: problems communicating, impulsive behaviors, difficulty expressing emotions and an interest in fire paraphernalia. Yet motives are often multiple and can be slippery to pin down. “We are still learning about the psychology of arson,” said Nichola Tyler, a senior lecturer in forensic psychology at Swinburne University of Technology in Australia. But there is growing urgency to better understand arson in order to tackle it. People are by far the biggest cause of fires and arson is significant factor.Roughly 20%of human-caused wildland fires in the US are set deliberately. As humans continue to warm the planet, increasing and worsening dangerous fire weather, it further raises the risk of arsonists setting catastrophic wildland fires. Many people are fascinated by fire from a young age. It’s fairly common for children to play with fire, said Caoilte Ó Ciardha, a senior lecturer in forensic psychology at the University of Kent. Adults often continue to enjoy it — cozy firepits, flickering candles, beach bonfires — but most age out of unsafe fire play. For a small minority, however, fire offers something different and darker. For some, it’s a means to an end. These are usually the one-and-done arsonists, Nordskog said. It’s the person who burns their car because they want the insurance money, or the business owner who sets fire to their office to destroy paperwork. Outdoor fires and serial fire-setters are a different story. While arson arrests during the LA fires piqued people’s interest, arson happens every single day in every big city, Nordskog said. Think dumpster fires, car fires and people burning garbage in alleys. Nobody cares until there is a wildfire happening at the same time, he said. Motivations for these urban fires are hugely varied. One woman arrested for allegedly setting fire to piles of trash during the LA fires said “she enjoyed causingchaos and destruction,” according to Jim McDonnell, chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, speaking at a January news conference. Seeing fire, or the emergency response to it, can stimulate people, said Tyler. But many experts say a desire to cause chaos is a rare motive. Surging homelessness, and the complex tangle of severe mental health problems the population endures, appears to be a much bigger factor. Many unhoused people accidentally set fires while cooking or trying to keep warm, but there is also a “significant” and growing proportion of serial arsonists among them, Nordskog said. In LA, he pins this in part on a burgeoning use of meth, which can cause serious mental health problemsincluding psychosis. Across the US “we’re seeing a lot of fires that are caused by folks with mental health issues,” said Scott Fischer, a retired federal arson investigator. He recalled a meth user who was convinced there were people living underground that meant him harm. “So, he started a fire to try and smoke them out,” Fischer told CNN. For the most part, these kinds of urban fires don’t cause extensive damage, Nordskog said. Many of those who set them have no interest in the fire itself. They often walk away afterward with little thought about what it might become. There’s another much smaller but far more dangerous subset of arsonists: serial wildland arsonists. They are rare, but are “the worst of the worst,” Nordskog said. “A true wildland serial arsonist has the power of an atomic bomb at their fingertips. No criminal in the world has that kind of power.” They tend to plan the event and take steps not to get caught, such as turning off their cellphones and using time-delayed incendiary devices, giving them time to get away. As with all arsonists, their motives vary, Nordskog said. For some it can be about power or anger, for others financial gain or excitement. In a surprising twist, firefighters make up a significant percentage of this group. Roughly a third of wildland arsonists are connected to the fire service, Nordskog said. In 2008, Robert Eason, a volunteer firefighter,received a 40-year sentencefor setting more than a dozen wildland fires in northern California. He was accused of using a coil-shaped time-delayed incendiary device that allowed him to escape the scene long before the fire took hold. Investigators suspect he may haveset more than 100 firesover nearly two decades. Eason’s motives are unknown, he denied setting the fires, but for some it’s about money. Volunteer firefighters in particular “don’t make money unless things are burning,” said Fischer, the federal investigator, whose career has focused on wildland fires. Another motive is thrill seeking or the chance to be a hero. Young, trainee firefighters are often spun a vision of going out every day to “fight the beast,” Nordskog said. But firefighting in relatively fire-safe countries like the US can be much more mundane; it may be months before many see their first fire. “Boredom causes a lot of problems in the firehouse,” Nordskog said. Although he stressed the roughly 100 firefighters arrested each year make up only a tiny sliver of themore than 1 million firefightersin the US. Climate change is adding a new dimension to arson. Wildfires are fueled by many factors but scientists say the climate crisis is loading the dice in favor of more frequent, intense fires and longer fire seasons. Awareness of theseincreasingly dangerous fire conditions doesn’t appear to be inspiring arsonists, said Gianni Muschetto, staff chief at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. “There’s not really any data to say during red flag conditions that we have an uptick in an arson fires,” he told CNN. But it does affect arsonists’ ability to cause destruction. As the world warms, “the risk of catastrophic outcomes is arguably heightened,” the forensic psychologist Tyler said. Not everyone sets a fire to cause harm but weather conditions can whip a small fire into a deadly blaze. A man was arrested last July for arson after allegedly starting California’s Park Fire by pushing a burning car down a 60-foot embankment, a charge he denies. It happened as an extreme heat wave parched the land, and the fire became one of the largest in California’s history, burning throughan area bigger than Houston. This is “the scary part,” Muschetto said. “If they light that fire, regardless of their intent, they have no control of how big it gets.”\n",
            "It was arguably the biggestred carpettrend of 2024, dominating the Academy Awards, the Met Gala and everything else in between. The naked dress — embraced by celebrities ranging fromElle Fanningto Kim Kardashian, Doja Cat to Charlize Theron — has become an eyebrow-raising red carpet fixture. At last year’s Vanity Fair Oscars after party, we saw how nudity could be both angelic (as demonstrated by Jennifer Lawerence’s sheer, Fall-Winter 1996 Givenchy empire-waist dress hand-embroidered with clovers) and risqué (such as Charli XCX’s gauzy yellow nipple-baring gown, also made by Givenchy.) But at Sunday’sGrammys, only one naked dress was turning heads. While most guests opted for muted palettes and pared-back styling amid tributes to victims of Los Angeles’ devastating wildfires, Bianca Censori took a different approach. Censori arrived at the event alongside husband Kanye West — who now goes by Ye. If the Australian model’s long feather coat seemed uncharacteristically demure, given her risqué approach to dressing in public, it was because she didn’t plan on wearing it for long. Within seconds of stopping for photos, the 30-year-old turned her back to the cameras and dropped her coat to reveal a barely-there sleeveless mini-dress made of transparent mesh that left nothing to the imagination. Naked dresses come in all shapes, sizes and varying levels of exposure. This genre of frock centers about the power of suggestion — sometimes, the wearer is not revealing anything at all. In the late 1990s, Jean-Paul Gaultier made waves with his trompe-l’oeil patterns, images of the bare human form, which he printed onto blazers and dresses. It’s a print that has since been revived by designers such as Glenn Martens, whose acid-colored, heatmap-style pieces have been worn by Bella Hadid and A$AP Rocky. Even some of the earliest examples of naked frocks — Mae West in the 1936 film “Go West, Young Man” or Carroll Baker’s Balmain dress worn while promoting “The Carpetbaggers” in 1964 — relied on expertly placed embroidery to give the impression of bare skin while avoiding any actual displays of nudity. Naked dresses, for all the fervent discussion, can be surprisingly modest. But what is the logical conclusion of a culture that revels in the suggestion of disrobing? To some — particularly those like Censori, who has frequently appeared in public in revealing outfits, whether heading into a music studio almost naked beneath a see-through rain jacket or going to dinner in LA wearing little more than a bra and a pair of sheer tights — the leap from naked dress to plain naked might feel small. On the Grammys red carpet, West, meanwhile, stood beside Censori in a black T-shirt and pants, expressionless behind a pair of sunglasses. Reports soon swirled that the couple were escorted out of the awards show. However, a source familiar with the sequence of events told CNN that was untrue. “He was not escorted out,” they said. “He’s a nominee. He walked the carpet and got in his car and left.” CNN has reached out to a representative for West for comment. Soon after the appearance, the couple shared Polaroid photos of Censori modeling the look in posts on their respective social media accounts. In a since-deleted Instagram post, West described his wife’s outfit as “custom couture,” yet there was no artistry or clever draping to be admired, no titillating embroidery techniques like those worn by West and Baker. The blankness of Censori’s nudity begs the question: is it fashion, or just a body? West has not confirmed whether he personally designed — or was involved in designing — Censori’s outfit, though social media users questioned the rapper’s role in his wife’s wardrobe choices. Others speculated that the model may have fallen afoul of California’s indecent exposure laws, which prohibit people from exposing their “naked body or genitals in front of anyone who could be annoyed or offended by it.” When asked if Censori had breached California’s indecent exposure laws, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department told CNN via email that it had “not been made aware of any incident at the Grammys.” The Recording Academy and CBS did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment. While Censori has certainly contributed a notable moment in the history of the naked dress trend, she has transformed what is typically a suggestive whisper into a deafening shout.\n",
            "President Donald Trump announced that he’spausing tariffs on Mexico and Canadaafter speaking to leaders of both countries on Monday — just hours before the sweeping actions were set to go into effect. The proposed tariffs, which Trump announced Saturday, consisted of a 25% duty on all imports from Mexico and most from Canada (there was a carve-out for a 10% tariff on energy products), and a new 10% tariff on Chinese goods. Trump said earlier Monday that he’d be speaking with China soon. Trump paused the tariffs on America’s neighbors after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made commitments, some of which they’d already made, to bolster security at their respective borders with the United States. “I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico. It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States,” Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier Monday. “These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our country,” he wrote. He took to Truth Social with a similar announcement later in the day, after Trudeau first announced the 30-day pause. “Canada has agreed to ensure we have a secure Northern Border, and to finally end the deadly scourge of drugs like Fentanyl that have been pouring into our Country, killing hundreds of thousands of Americans, while destroying their families and communities all across our Country,” Trump posted. (AsCNN has reported, Canada makes up just 0.2% of border fentanyl seizures.) After his call with Trump, Trudeau said Canada would be implementing its previously announced $1.3 billion border plan, as well as committing to appointing a “fentanyl czar” and listing cartels as terrorists. The extraordinary tariff announcement over the weekend against America’s three largest trading partners hadraised alarm even among some corners of Trump’s own party andsent shockwaves through the North American economy, rattling businesses and the markets and deliveringuncertainty to consumerswho are still reeling from years of high inflation. And Trump’s tariff promises had also already kicked off a trade war. Canada ordered retaliatory tariffs, and China said it would “take necessary countermeasures.” Trump’s executive orders that put tariffs into motion included a retaliation clause, which indicated that America could launch even steeper tariffs and raise costs even further. The president has also suggested another round of tariffs later this month, perhaps on other countries. But even Trump, a longtime proponent of tariffs,acknowledged on Sundaywhat economists, members of Congress and even some of his own aides — in their previous lives — have warned: Americans could pay the cost of the new tariffs. Economists have said that the North American tariffs, should they materialize, would swiftly send the Canadian and Mexican economies into recession and likelylift consumer prices for Americanson cars, gasoline,lumberand other imported items. The Dow tumbled nearly 600 points at the opening bell, but news of the agreement with Mexicosent stocks on the verge of a comeback. Trump shrugged off the market reaction on Monday, suggesting to the reporters in the Oval Office that he wasn’t aware of the volatility. “I don’t know. I don’t think about it,” he said. The Wall Street Journal had delivered a blistering critique of the Trump tariffs in a weekend editorial entitled: “The dumbest trade war in history.” When asked the about market reaction — and the Wall Street Journal’s editorial — Trump demurred on Monday when signing executive actions in the Oval Office. “Not only is it not dumb, you’re going to see, you’re going to see every single one of those countries is dying to make a deal,” he said, sitting feet away from Rupert Murdoch, whose newspaper empire includes the Journal. The pause in the tariffs on Mexico was praised by Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is pleading with Trump to exempt potash from tariffs because of the potential impact to Iowa family farmers, whom he said get majority of the fertilizer from Canada. “Good news on Mexico tariff pause for 1 month,” Grassleyposted on Xon Monday. “Hopefully negotiating will preempt more talk of tariffs.” Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican and frequent Trump critic, had also warned about tariffs on Canada, writing on X that it’s Maine’s “most important trading partner.” Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former GOP Senate leader, had criticized Trump’s tariff measures in an interview that aired on CBS’ “60 Minutes” on Sunday. “It will drive the cost of everything up. In other words, it will be paid for by American consumers,” the Kentucky senator said. “I mean, why would you want to get in a fight with your allies over this?” Trump said on Monday he looked forward to participating in negotiations with Mexico. “We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period during which we will have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and high-level Representatives of Mexico,” he wrote. “I look forward to participating in those negotiations, with President Sheinbaum, as we attempt to achieve a ‘deal’ between our two Countries.” Mexico will send 10,000 National Guard troops to its northern border to help reduce the flow of fentanyl into the US, reinforce the border and help improve security in its own territory, Sheinbaum said at her morning press conference Monday. “For humanitarian reasons, we must help the United States address its fentanyl consumption crisis, which is leading to overdose deaths,” she said at her morning press conference Monday. Sheinbaum also noted that the US, for the first time, has agreed to work together to prevent high-powered weapons from entering Mexico. “I believe this is a very important aspect of the agreement we reached,” she said. Officials from the US and Mexico will continue to hold high-level talks on security, migration and trade after agreeing to pause tariffs for a month, Sheinbaum said. Sheinbaum also told Trump that she disagreed with his comment that the Mexican government has links with cartels. “There is no way we would come to an agreement under those circumstances,” she said. Tariffs — and the mere threat of them — served as go-to policy moves for Trump in his first term and were expected to be key pillars in his second. “The president has used tariffs as a leverage tool,” Brett Ryan, senior US economist at Deutsche Bank, told CNN on Monday. “Eventually you’re going to have to implement them or else your threats become meaningless.” “I think businesses have already been preparing to the extent that they can,” Ryan said. “The threat obviously doesn’t go away, and it’s still out there. At some point you are going to get tariff actions.” At the very least, the agreementinjects further unpredictabilityinto the US economy. “What we’re seeing this morning does really highlight that there’s a lot of uncertainty about how policies unfold,” Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins said in a CNBC interview Monday morning following the announcements from Sheinbaum and Trump. “Without knowing what actual policy will be implemented, it’s just really not possible to be too precise about what the likely impacts are going to be,” added Collins, who is voting on interest rate decisions this year. Collins noted that the broad-based tariffs Trump placed on Mexico, Canada and China are highly unusual, making it harder for central bank economists to analyze the potential economic impact. For now, Collins said her expectation is that any new tariffs will cause prices for goods to go up, but said she’s not convinced that it will necessarily lead to higher inflation levels.

            "The music is booming, the lights are turned down low. The series of customary hype videos have played, and the crowd is being egged on to cheer by the stadium hosts. A marching band takes the field as the tension rises. Finally, the players take the field and it’s time. The press conferences can finally begin! Opening Night at the Super Bowl,the event formerly known as Media Day, is what happens when a usually dull press gathering becomes an audience-friendly spectacle. What was once a Tuesday afternoon event full of reporters asking about football with the occasional silliness is now a full-blown Monday night event, complete with all the trappings of the build-up to a NFL football game. Except, you know – it’s basically a press conference. Super Bowl Opening Night is a bewildering sight of grandeur, spectacle and the mundane business of people asking other people questions. And yet, there were still thousands of screaming fans inside of the cavernous Caesars Superdome hoping to get a glimpse of their heroes and maybe score an autograph or a selfie. The first loud cheer of the night set the tone for this intrepid reporter. As the media walks onto the field about 20 minutes before the Philadelphia Eagles are set to take their place under the lights, a big cheer goes up. The target of those screams: Guillermo Rodriguez, Jimmy Kimmel’s lovable sidekick on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” The scene is reminiscent of the early stages of a music festival. The crowd – thousands strong but still not even filling one side of the lower bowl of the more than 75,000 seats in the Superdome – is enthusiastic but sparse. Explosions of color all around the iconic dome that’s hosting its 11th edition of the Super Bowl – those New Orleans mainstays of purple, green and yellow – make up for the dimness. The Soul Rebels, a New Orleans-based brass band, are filling the place with music but the lack of people in all those seats means the sound bounces around like a fumbled football. The field itself is protected from the mass of reporters and other media figures who are milling the sidelines, save for the stage that the Rebels are playing on. The figures on the sideline have such an incredible range that it almost has to be seen to be believed. There are the grizzled reporters who have been doing this for decades. There are Super Bowl rookies staring around the place with eyes as wide as dinner plates (this reporter falls into that camp), there are members of the international media who have flown from around the world to be here. And there’s also a guy dressed like the Genie from Disney’s “Aladdin,” encouraging players to make a wish with his face painted completely blue. There’s even two guys dressed up like Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni and Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid, Aloha shirt and all. Before the Eagles enter, the cheerleaders from both teams perform a mostly coordinated routine alongside their teams’ mascots. A hype video plays, with bass so intense that chests are rattling all around the Superdome. There’s a slight break in programming before yet another hype video plays. Once that’s finished, the St. Augustine High School Purple Knights Marching Band begins to play and walks onto the playing surface, trailed by the Eagles in their all-white Super Bowl sweatsuits. If the goal was to build the atmosphere to a fever pitch, the Eagles – calmly walking onto the stage set up between the 30 and 40-yard lines – did not get the memo. Their vibe could not be more different than the spectacle that preceded them. With that, the players disperse to their assigned podium or mill about on the sidelines of the field as the questions begin to fly. It’s not exactly the most peaceful work environment – music continues to boom through the sound system whenever interviews from other podiums are not being shown on the big screen, also at top volume. It makes it nearly impossible to hear the questions being asked or the answers being given unless you’re right next to a speaker or the person you’re interviewing. The topics of the Q-and-As themselves veer wildly. One minute, a player is giving a detailed answer about all the work it took for him to be on a team that’s going to the Super Bowl. In the next, they’re being ambushed by a Nickelodeon social media producer to name five cartoon characters in less than 30 seconds. At one point, Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley ended up with a Nickelodeon blimp for reasons that were not clear thanks to the din in the room. Players and coaches roam all over the sidelines for interviews, but occasionally they have the option of stopping for a quick game of Madden in a setup in the southeast corner of the field. It appears the only matchup available is Chiefs-Eagles – it’s unclear if any player was forced to play as their future opponents on Sunday instead of their own team. The players hardly leave empty handed. All manners of gifts are passed up to them from the throng of people in front of their podiums. Chiefs superstar Travis Kelce made out with a couple of soccer jerseys emblazoned with his name on the back. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes got a pillow of some sort. The public relations staffers standing guard on either side of the podium were also turned into baggage handlers as the gifts kept coming. The night is overall a light-hearted moment in what has been an increasingly serious few months for the players taking the field on Sunday. Every game toward the end of the regular season and every second of each playoff game is so filled with stakes and anxiety that it’s hard for fans to breathe, let alone the guys on each team. From Monday night onward, it’s back to business. The teams have media availabilities for more football-centric questions the next few days before they hunker down in final preparations for the biggest game of the season. But that tension, that feeling of being in the final stretch run, is still evident if you really look for it. One of those moments came when Cleveland Browns quarterback Jameis Winston, working for Fox Sports during Opening Night, pops up to ask Mahomes a question. As Winston, one of the league’s most charismatic figures, finished up his back-and-forth with Mahomes, the ebullient quarterback-turned-reporter made a call back to hisfamous “eat a W” pregame speech seven years agoby tossing Mahomes a W-shaped cookie. “Man, I know you’re in it to win it. Will you please eat this W with me?” Winston said, tossing the cookie like a Frisbee over the heads of camera operators and reporters. Mahomes caught half of it – it broke upon colliding with his hand – and made a motion like he was going to take a bite. But with just a few days before a chance at a historic three-peat, the Kansas City quarterback was taking no chances with his nutrition. With Winston’s blessing, he put the cookie remnants on the table and went on to his next question. It was a scene emblematic of Opening Night in New Orleans: Funny and quirky but everything is geared toward Sunday. Kickoff for Super Bowl LIX between the Chiefs and Eagles is set for 6:30 p.m. ET.\n",
            "In ski towns, “earning your turns” comes with inalienable bragging rights. The term, thought to originate from backcountry skiers in search of untouched snow, often involves bypassing ski lifts, gondolas and any other mechanized way up the mountain in favor of ascending on human power alone. “Earning your turns” usually requires using specialized ski equipment made for traveling uphill. That includes special bindings and boots paired with “skins” — sheaths of synthetic fabric placed on the undersides of skis to give them traction in the snow (in the past, seal skins were used). Alternatively, you can carry your gear on your back and hike up — all for the rush of skiing pristine runs down the mountain. Backcountry skiing and ski mountaineering, which involves summiting peaks with alpine gear, are versions of traveling uphill in the snow. But a less extreme, fitness-oriented version of “uphilling” is on the rise within resort boundaries at US ski resorts. It’s attracting skiers beyond the backcountry set in search of a good workout with the added bonus of fresh air and fresh tracks — often before the mountain opens to lift-access for the day. Ski areas allowing uphill access (designated routes and hours when skiers, hikers and snowshoers can walk up the mountain) have increased by nearly a third over the past decade, according to statistics from theNational Ski Areas Association, a trade association for ski area owners and operators that represents over 300 alpine resorts in the United States. An end-of-season association report shows 65% of NSAA resorts permitted uphill access in at least some form during the 2023/24 season compared with roughly 33% in 2013/14. Uphilling hours, designated routes and what you’ll pay to do it varies depending on the resort. At some ski resorts, uphill skiing access is allowed only before and after regular resort operating hours, while others may allow it during operating hours. Next time you ride the chair lift up the mountain, look for parallel tracks leading upward along the side of the trail (or, in steeper terrain, a zig-zagging path). “It’s huge, really, how much uphilling at the resorts has grown,” says Cara Marrs, 55, adietitianand devoted uphiller and backcountry skier who has lived in Steamboat Springs,Colorado, for 27 years. Steamboatski resort allows uphill access before 9 a.m. and after 4:30 p.m. daily with the purchase of a $39 armband, which you can buy online after watching a safety video and signing a waiver. “I do feel like back in the day there were not that many people on the ski area skinning up, it was more for backcountry skiing. But now people are doing it for fitness,” Marrs says. Uphilling has become a form of on-mountain camaraderie as much as a fitness craze in many mountain towns, saysBrody Leven,37, a professional adventure skier and ski mountaineer who lives in Salt Lake City, Utah, and says he is “entirely human-powered.” “In the winter, the majority of the way that I and many skiers catch up with our friends is on the skin track, as we call it, which is on the hike up. You have so much quality time to talk with someone,” he says. And while Leven hasn’t used any mechanized manner to get up the mountain in at least a decade and spends most of his time ski mountaineering in the backcountry in Utah and beyond, he says uphilling in-bounds at resorts is more mainstream. “There’s a huge variety of equipment, huge variety of people. It can be casual, it can be inexpensive, and it’s generally safe. I think people are looking to get outdoors,” he said about the pursuit. In addition to skins, skiers and ski mountaineers use specialized bindings and boots that allow their heels to move freely compared with downhill skis (you clip back into the bindings when it’s time to ski down). “Splitboard” snowboards can be split in two halves for walking on them uphill, too. The skins are removed and stashed away when it’s time to ski or snowboard down the mountain. “The uphill is where you get the workout. But the whole purpose is to get the downhill,” says Marrs. “If you go up on the ski area and it’s a powder day, and you’re going at 5:30 or six in the morning, you’re going to get the most delicious … first run down.” While uphilling in-bounds at resorts mainly requires good fitness and the ability to ski down (unless you plan to ride the lift), ski mountaineering can also require ice climbing and rock climbing skills, says Leven. An offshoot of ski mountaineering referred to asskimothat involves racing is set to debut for the first time as an Olympic sport at theMilano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games. Terrin Abell, program manager at theBreckenridge Recreation Centerin Breckenridge, Colorado, says she’d never heard of uphilling when she first moved to the ski town in 2011. “A group of friends wanted to do a full moon ski, and that was my first experience with it,” she says. Abell, who snowboarded and skied at the time, decided to carry her snow board up the mountain since she didn’t have the right skis for walking up. Her friends skinned up on their skis, and they all enjoyed a moonlit run down empty slopes. After that, she says, she was hooked. By the next year, Abell had invested in alpine touring skis to make it easier to get up the mountain and venture into the backcountry, too. Every year, she and a group of friends take part in theImperial Challenge, a rite of spring in Breckenridge. The challenge involves biking or running from the Breckenridge Recreation Center to the base of Peak 7 atBreckenridge Ski Resortbefore transitioning to ski gear to walk (or for some, run) uphill to the top of Peak 8. “I will be in a tutu, I will be in a costume. I do these things because I’m in it for the fun,” Abell says. Not all resorts allow uphilling, and policies vary at ski resorts that do allow it. Those can usually be found online. You should always check ahead of your visit to understand the hours and routes allowed as well as what sort of ski pass is required. Some resorts require an additional fee on top of a regular ski pass to travel uphill, some require just a pass for uphilling, and others don’t charge at all. Arizona ski resortSnowbowlhas anuphill accesspolicy that allows it only on designated routes that change with ongoing snowmaking, grooming and weather conditions. At Snowbowl, uphilling is allowed only outside normal lift-operating hours, so uphillers have access to certain routes  Monday to Friday from 5 a.m. to 8 a.m. and from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday from 4:30 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. and from 4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Snowbowl’s uphill access permit is free, and you can apply for it online after signing a waiver. Interest in uphill access at Snowbowl — particularly from pass holders and local guests — has been booming, says Angie Grubb, the resort’s marketing manager. “It’s great because not only is it free, but this is also a really good opportunity for outdoor enthusiasts and runners and hikers to train in the winter, when hiking tracks around the area are often muddy,” she says. Utah’sPowder Mountainallows uphill travel during the ski resort’s operating hours only in designated areas and on approved routes, with a lift ticket or season ski pass required for access. The resort hosts a skimo race, theLightning Ridge Relay, every year. Also in Utah,Alta Ski Areadoes not permit uphill skiing at all during the operating ski season because of heavy equipment operations and avalanche mitigation, says Lexi Dowdall, the resort’s communications manager. Before the ski season officially opens and after it closes, however, Alta’s terrain is open to backcountry skiers who understand they are completely on their own and responsible for their own actions. It’s imperative to ski with backcountry equipment and a partner, says Dowdall. “We’ve seen more and more folks coming to take advantage of that uphill policy beyond our operating season. Preseason and postseason, people are using Alta like crazy to go uphill. My last ski day last season was June 20, and I was skiing up here at Alta,” she says. Aspen Snowmassin Colorado has some of the mostliberal policiesfor uphilling, according to Dan Sherman of ski travel agencySki.com, which sells ski vacation packages that include lift tickets, lodging and more. It’s possible to ski uphill at three out of four of the resort’s mountains —Snowmass, Buttermilk and Aspen Highlands — from 5 a.m. to 10:30 p.m., including during resort operating hours. AtAspen Mountain, uphilling is off limits during operating hours between 9am and 4:45 p.m., but permitted before and after hours. Designated “safe routes” up are marked by signs to make sure uphillers don’t find themselves in the blind spots of skiers coming down the mountain. Uphill passes at AspenSnowmass for activities including skiing, snowshoeing and walking cost $69 (free for Premier Passholders) and are good for the entire season,which is considerably less than aday’s lift ticket. Uphilling is a “very big deal” in Aspen, says Sherman, who lives in the  famous ski town. “It’s like going out for a hike in the winter, you just happen to be going up the mountain. And then your reward is being able to go down it skiing,” he says. Before attempting uphill skiing for the first time, school yourself on the rules. In addition to staying on designated routes as you ascend,always yield to downhill skiers and keep aware of hazards in the form of grooming and snowmaking equipment as well as snowcats. Wearing a brightly colored ski jacket and pants will make you more visible on the mountain, too. Abell, from Breckenridge, cautions that uphilling isn’t for everyone. The exertion involved in getting up the mountain –- especially on cold, dark mornings — is significant. (Uphill access at Breckenridge is available from the resort’s closing time at 5 p.m. until 8:15 a.m.) “The first couple times I’m like, ‘why am I doing it?’ ” Abell says. “But then the sun comes up, and then you get to the top. Then you transition and then you ski down, and you’re like, ‘Wow, that was the best thing ever.’ ” Florida-based travel writerTerry Wardlives in Tampa and is skiing in Switzerland’s Jungfrau Region soon, where she will be riding chairlifts and gondolas.\n",
            "The Aga Khan, who became the spiritual leader of the world’s millions of Ismaili Muslims at age 20 as a Harvard undergraduate and poured a material empire built on billions of dollars in tithes into building homes, hospitals and schools in developing countries, has died. He was 88. His Aga Khan Foundation and the Ismaili religious community announced on their websites that His Highness Prince Karim Al-Hussaini, the Aga Khan IV and 49th hereditary imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims, died Tuesday in Portugal surrounded by his family. They said an announcement on his successor would come later. Considered by his followers to be a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, His Highness Prince Karim Aga Khan IV was a student when his grandfather passed over his playboy father as his successor to lead the diaspora of Shia Ismaili Muslims, saying his followers should be led by a young man “who has been brought up in the midst of the new age.” Over decades, the Aga Khan evolved into a business magnate and a philanthropist, moving between the spiritual and the worldly and mixing them with ease. Treated as a head of state, the Aga Khan was given the title of “His Highness” by Queen Elizabeth in July 1957, two weeks after his grandfather the Aga Khan III unexpectedly made him heir to the family’s 1,300-year dynasty as leader of the Ismaili Muslim sect. He became the Aga Khan IV on Oct. 19, 1957, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on the spot where his grandfather once had his weight equaled in diamonds in gifts from his followers. He had left Harvard to be at his ailing grandfather’s side, and returned to school 18 months later with an entourage and a deep sense of responsibility. “I was an undergraduate who knew what his work for the rest of his life was going to be,” he said in a 2012 interview with Vanity Fair magazine. “I don’t think anyone in my situation would have been prepared.” A defender of Islamic culture and values, he was widely regarded as a builder of bridges between Muslim societies and the West despite — or perhaps because of — his reticence to become involved in politics. The Aga Khan Development Network, his main philanthropic organization, dealt mainly with issues of health care, housing, education and rural economic development. A network of hospitals bearing his name are scattered in countries where health care had lacked for the poorest, including Bangladesh, Tajikistan and Afghanistan, where he spent tens of millions of dollars for development of local economies. His eye for building and design led him to establish an architecture prize, and programs for Islamic Architecture at MIT and Harvard. He restored ancient Islamic structures throughout the world. Accounts differ as to the date and place of Prince Karim Aga Khan’s birth. According to “Who’s Who in France,” he was born on Dec. 13, 1936, in Creux-de-Genthod, near Geneva, Switzerland, the son of Joan Yarde-Buller and Aly Khan. The extent of the Aga Khan’s financial empire is hard to measure. Some reports estimated his personal wealth to be in the billions. The Ismailis — a sect originally centered in India but which expanded to large communities in east Africa, Central and South Asia and the Middle East — consider it a duty to tithe up to 10% of their income to him as steward. “We have no notion of the accumulation of wealth being evil,” he told Vanity Fair in 2012. “The Islamic ethic is that if God has given you the capacity or good fortune to be a privileged individual in society, you have a moral responsibility to society.” He is survived by three sons and a daughter.\n",
            "The City of London financial district has approved plans for a 73-floor skyscraper that will match in height Western Europe’stallest towera mile to the south, in a sign that city planners are still betting on the office market despite the current downturn. The proposed 309.6-meter (1,015.75-foot) tower, which will be exactly the same height as London’s Shard, was given the go-ahead after a previously approved plan was revised “to better respond to post-pandemic office needs,” the City of London local authority said on Friday. Officially called 1 Undershaft, the tower was initially granted approval at a slightly smaller height in 2016 but never started. The proposed building, which investor Aroland has been trying to get off the ground for years, will require the demolition of an existing smaller tower and has attracted criticism from conservation groups. Historic England said in a consultation response to City planners in February that the alterations had not altered its impact and said it would “seriously degrade” the public realm around it. The tower, if built, would provide 154,156 square meters (around 1.66 million square feet) of office space, areas for children’s education on the 72nd and 73rd floors and a publicly accessible garden. London’s office market has been hit hard by higher borrowing costs and more home working post-pandemic, although premium space has remained in demand. Very few major London office properties have been sold this year. Investors Nuveen and Brookfield are currently trying to sell London office towers, in a major test for investor appetite. The supply of new space to let in London has slowed since the pandemic. However, office construction in the City has recently bucked the trend, with new starts up 7% between April and September this year, compared to falls in every other central London market surveyed by Deloitte. Critics say London’s skyline has become increasingly cluttered by generic glass-and-metal towers that dwarf historic landmarks, especially in the City of London, home to St. Paul’s Cathedral. “As another, much needed office development gets approved in the City of London, it speaks to the confidence that global investors have in the London real estate market and the UK economy more widely,” said Shravan Joshi, chairman of the City of London Corporation’s Planning and Transportation Committee. The Shard, currently the tallest skyscraper in Western Europe, was completed in 2012.\n",
            "Jason Dale had started planning his family’s summer vacation to Tennessee a year ago. It was to be the Canadian family’s final hurrah, a send-off vacation before his oldest son, who is 18, leaves the family nest. Together with two other families, Dale, his husband and three sons were going to set off from their Port Dover home in southwestern Ontario for a 10-day road trip that would take them to Dollywood, the Titanic Museum Attraction and into the Great Smoky Mountains. They had mapped out the route, their rest stops, and booked their resort. It was a trip that Dale had done before when his kids were little, and everyone was looking forward to reliving fond family memories. They’ve now scrapped all those travel plans. After Donald Trump was elected president, the group of 11 decided to take a “wait and see” approach. But the US president’s threat to impose punishing tariffs and to annex Canada, along with his trolling of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who Trump called “Governor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada,” were the last straw. “The rhetoric about tariffs, the mockery of our prime minister and the musing about us becoming the 51st state, that did it for all of us,” Dale told CNN Travel. “Everyone was in agreement that we’re not going. We’re going to keep our money in our own country.” Dale is part of a growing chorus of angry Canadians who have become vocal about boycotting travel to the US over the next four years. People on both sides of the border are already reporting travel-related fallout, with anxiety running both ways. On social media, the discourse among many Canadians is a mix of worry, fear, outrage and disappointment. While some vow not to step foot in the US while Trump is in office, others say they are torn, as they have upcoming family or professional commitments. Posts on social media suggest some Canadian snowbirds who usually escape Canadian winters in states like Florida or Arizona now say they are choosing to winter at home or are making a permanent move back north. Some pledge to only visit Democrat-leaning states like California and New York. Others say they will continue to visit but spend at Black, Latino, POC and LGBTQ+-owned businesses and support marginalized groups perceived to have a target on their back under the Trump administration. On Saturday, Trump announcedsignificant new tariffson Canada that were due to go into effect on February 4 but were paused for one month after last-minute talks between the US president and Trudeau.Mexico and China were also targeted with new tariffs. In a solemn 13-minute speech Saturday, Trudeau appealed to Canadians to do their part and to “choose Canada.” “There are many ways for you to do your part,” he said. “It might mean checking the labels at the supermarket and picking Canadian-made products. It might mean opting for Canadian rye over Kentucky bourbon or forgoing Florida orange juice altogether. It might mean changing your summer vacation plans to stay here in Canada and explore the many national and provincial parks, historical sites and tourist destinations our great country has to offer.” Dale, a 52-year-old high school teacher, had budgeted spending around $5,000 CAD (about $3,430 USD) on his family’s Tennessee vacation. The other two families included a family of four and a single mother and her child. Canada is the largest source of international visitors to the US. According to the US Travel Association, 20.4 million Canadians visited the country last year, generating $20.5 billion USD in spending. Just a 10% reduction in Canadian travel would result in $2.1 billion USD in lost spending and 14,000 job losses, the group warned in a press release. According to the latest figures from Statistics Canada, Canadians also pumped $6.5 billion CAD (about $4.5 billion USD) into the US economy in the second quarter of 2024 alone, spending an average of $1,001 CAD per trip (about $685 USD), with the bulk of their spending going towards accommodations, restaurants and bars. They stayed for an average of four nights. The top most visited states among Canadian visitors are Florida, California, Nevada, New York and Texas. Kristine Geary, founder of the motor coach tour company Maple Leaf Tours in Kingston, Ontario, said her business has already taken a 30% hit in cancellations for her US packages this year, which include destinations like Nashville, Washington and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The morning Geary spoke to CNN, a couple had canceled their booking for Washington, DC. “Many of our clients are reluctantly canceling their tours to the US with disappointment because they’re putting their long-anticipated plans on hold,” Geary said. “The hesitation and unpredictability surrounding what’s happening and travel to the US have created challenges, and it’s difficult for me to maintain stability and growth.” Across the border, New Jersey resident Monica Church is also starting to feel the effects of the trade war. Soon after Trudeau announced retaliatory tariffs, Church received a contrite message from a Canadian couple who canceled their month-long stay at her vacation rental in North Myrtle Beach over the weekend. In their message, they cited the trade war as the reason for their cancellation. Far from being upset at the $2,000 USD loss, Church said she understood and was impressed by the couple’s commitment to cancel their holiday in the name of Canadian solidarity. “I’m a little jealous of that feeling, where you feel for your country so much that you band together,” Church told CNN Travel. “Kind of like how everyone felt after 9/11, you felt proud to be American. I haven’t felt proud to be an American lately.” While gun violence has always been a concern for Canadian travelers, Trump’s crackdown on the trans and immigrant communities has also raised more alarm bells around safety for some would-be visitors. When his middle son expressed anxiety about traveling to the US with his two gay dads, Dale said he knew they couldn’t go through with the trip. “That just did it for me,” he said. Colleen Whale, 41, from Barrie, Ontario, also mused aloud that in a climate of political upheaval, nothing is certain. “I have a rainbow on my fanny pack, so am I now a walking target? I’m not part of the LGBTQ+ community but I’m an ally.” After retaliatory tariffs from Canada, it could be gloves off for some Americans, she added. “If I show my Canadianism just by the way I speak, is that going to put a target on my back?” But the fear and anxiety run both ways. Church, who had been discussing a road trip to Montreal and Quebec with her husband this year, also wonders if their American license plate could make them targets in Canada. “We’re kind of nervous if Canadians are going to be upset with Americans.” Whale had not entertained these questions when she traveled to Nashville in 2023 with her mom for CMA Fest, a country music festival. They had enjoyed themselves so much that she promised to take her mother again in 2026 to celebrate her 75th birthday. But the more she watched the news, Whale said she realized she couldn’t go through with it. With a heavy heart, she went to her mother’s house to announce her decision, breaking down in tears. Her mother, too, broke down, agreeing it was for the best. “I just didn’t want to disappoint her,” Whale said. “And all of the feelings of the heaviness of the world, it just got to me. It got to both of us.” Wedding photographer Tamara Boden, 41, pointed out that while it’s “not Trump’s first rodeo,” his second presidency is markedly different for Canadians. “For me, as a Canadian, these threatening talks of making Canada the 51st state are alarming and enraging,” Boden said from her home in Trail, British Columbia. “That’s different this time around. There’s very real talk about a war on women and a war on minorities. It feels scary as someone with a uterus to go into the States.” Boden lives 10 miles from the US border. Like many of her neighbors, a typical weekend might involve piling the kids in the car, driving across the border to grab lunch at a good Mexican restaurant, and shopping at stores like Trader Joe’s and Target that aren’t available in Canada. That won’t be happening again soon, she said. “That’s not going to be how I spend my Saturday for sure. Not for the next four years at least.” In a recent survey published by travel management company Corporate Traveller Canada, 85% of the 1,000 small and medium-sized enterprises polled said they anticipate reducing their cross-border travel if tariffs are imposed. Chris Lynes, managing director for Flight Centre Travel Group Canada, which includes Corporate Traveller, said though the company hadn’t seen mass cancellations for travel to the US so far, the new tariffs and the plummeting value of the Canadian dollar are expected to have significant repercussions for travel across the border. “If we are hit with broad tariffs, we will see quite the slowdown in travel, especially to the US,” Lynes said, adding that affordability is the main driver of travel behavior. The Canadian dollar tumbled to a 22-year-low amid tariff uncertainty but rebounded Mondayamid speculation about the reprieve. But Canadians like Boden say the decision to boycott travel to the US is driven first by a moral imperative, and less a financial one. For their upcoming family trip to Mexico, Boden said they will forgo their usual strategy of crossing the border and flying out of a US airport, which is much cheaper, and pony up the extra $200 CADto fly out of Vancouver. Because money talks, she said, and the turn of events in the US made her realize she’d rather support the local Canadian economy over the US. “It’s not just a matter of sticking it to the Americans, because I do believe that the average American is good-hearted. But unfortunately, the person running their country is unhinged at the moment.”\n",
            "A deadline to begin talks on extending Gaza’s ceasefire arrived Monday with the Israeli prime minister in Washington, silence from his office about when a negotiating team might engage with Hamas, and considerable uncertainty about what the next stage of the fragile truce will look like. The ceasefire, in place for just over two weeks, is set to expire on March 1. Under the terms of the deal, talks on the next phase are supposed to begin no later than Monday. But the Israeli government has yet to publicly unveil a negotiating team for the talks, let alone send them to Qatar or Egypt, where Hamas is sending a delegation this week. Hamas has not publicly commented on Monday’s deadline. Qatar’s prime minister, who has acted as an intermediary in the talks, said Sunday that there were “no clear details” on when or how the talks would start. “We hope to see some movement in the coming days,” Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said during a press conference in Doha. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made clear that he sees the path forward not in Doha or Cairo, but in Washington, where he will this week become the first foreign leader to hold a formal meeting with US President Donald Trump. Netanyahu’s office said on the eve of his departure that he had agreed with Trump’s Middle East envoy that “negotiations on the second phase of the hostage deal will begin with their meeting in Washington,” during which “they will discuss Israel’s positions.” Since the ceasefire went into effect on January 19, Hamas and its allies have released 18 hostages held in Gaza. In exchange, the Israeli government has released 583 Palestinians held in detention – some serving life sentences for serious offenses – but also a significant number of children held without public charge or trial. The ceasefire has seen the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gazan population centers, a surge of aid entering the enclave and, for the first time since May last year, the opening of the vital Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt for the evacuation of injured and sick Palestinians. It has also largely held apart from a few violations – only the second respite in 15 months of war, after a brief truce in November 2023. But the first phase of the truce was only ever meant to last 42 days. Talks for the second phase must begin Monday, the 16th day of the truce, meaning that Netanyahu is  breaching the terms of the deal by talking to Trump first. Over that second period, CNN understands that the Israeli military would fully withdraw from Gaza and all living hostages, soldier and civilian, would be released in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners. Chief among Netanyahu’s concerns this week will be what Trump wants. The American president was not yet in office during the first round of ceasefire talks, though his team played a large role in pushing Israel toward a deal. “Our decisions and the courage of our soldiers have redrawn the map,” Netanyahu said on the tarmac of Ben Gurion Airport Sunday. “But I believe that, working closely with President Trump, we can redraw it even further and for the better.” But Gershon Baskin, a veteran Israeli negotiator and peace activist, said in a statement that Netanyahu’s “refusal to begin negotiations on the day stipulated in the agreement is a clear violation of the agreement.” “Israel demands that Hamas adhere to all the terms of the agreement, while simultaneously violating it in a significant way. Once again, Netanyahu is abandoning the hostages and endangering them.” Trump claimed credit for the current ceasefire and pledged upon taking office to end foreign wars. But he has also now repeated his desire for the 2 million people of Gaza to leave so that “we just clean out that whole thing.” The forced displacement of civilians can constitute “a war crime and/or crime against humanity,” according to the United Nations. Trump’s proposal was music to the ears of the most extreme minister in Netanyahu’s governing coalition. Finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, who vehemently opposed the withdrawal of Israeli forces and settlers from Gaza in 2005, wants Jews to resettle in the enclave. “Encouraging migration (of Palestinians out of Gaza) is the only solution that will bring peace and security to the residents of Israel and alleviate the suffering of Gaza’s Arab residents,” he said after Trump expressed his desire for Palestinians to leave. Already one minister – the far-right Itamar Ben-Gvir – has withdrawn his party from the Israeli government over the ceasefire, calling it a capitulation. Smotrich has pledged he will do the same if Israel does not renew the war in Gaza when the current, first phase of the ceasefire expires.\n",
            "Kultida Woods, the mother ofTiger Woods, golf’s biggest star, died Tuesday, according to the 15-time major winner. He did not give a cause of her death. “My Mom was a force of nature all her own, her spirit was simply undeniable. She was quick with the needle and a laugh,” Tiger Woodsposted on X. “She was my biggest fan, greatest supporter, without her none of my personal achievements would have been possible. She was loved by so many, but especially by her two grandchildren, Sam andCharlie.” Tiger Woodsthanked his fans for their support andprayers and asked for privacy “at this difficult time for me and my family.” The 82-time PGA Tour winner ended his message with: “Love you Mom.” Kultida Woods, a native of Thailand, was often seen by her son’s side. She was highlighted last month when Tiger Woodscompeted in a Tomorrow’s Golf League (TGL) match. While attending the SoFi Center in Florida, the ESPN broadcast showed Kultida Woods smiling and clapping after her famous son sank a clutch putt. She stood by her son when the famed golfer faced one of his darkest moments – when he helda globally viewed press conference in 2010 confessing to having engaged in multiple extramarital affairs. Kultida Woods sat posed in the front row of the public confession with Tiger Woods admittinghis actions were “not acceptable” and that he had “stopped living by the core values” his parents taught him. Tiger Woods said his mother was the key to him wearing the now-iconic red and black outfit combination he wore on the final day of golf tournaments. “My mom thought, being a Capricorn, that (red) was my power color, or some BS thing like that, so I end up wearing red and end up winning some golf tournaments,” Tiger Woods told Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show” last year. “And then, to spite her, I wore blue and I did not win those tournaments. So, Mom is always right.” Tiger’s father, Earl Woods, died in 2006.\n",
            "Haute couture is an enigma to most. Accessible to only a select few (an estimated few thousand people globally) because of the eye-watering price tags that such extraordinary designs command, the fashion designers who partake in the exclusive event in Paris must ensure that strict criteria are met, in order to be approved by the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, France’s governing fashion body. Taking place following men’s fashion week, during which ready-to-wear designs are shown, the haute couture shows serve a wholly different purpose. The pieces are not intended for everyday wear and cannot simply be purchased off the rails at a department store (couture clients make direct orders and have private fittings). With that, the designs are often more experimental than commercial, and showcase exceptional savoir-faire. The week had plenty of celebratory moments, including Chanel’s 110 years in haute couture. Presented in the Grand Palais, on a runway that featured a crossing C formed by two monumental staircases, reflecting the house’s double-C logo, the collection was designed by the studio while awaiting the arrival of new designer Matthieu Blazy, who is expected to join by April 2025. The cropped skirt-suits in richly embroidered tweeds, embellished hem and shoulder lines, soft silk shirt dresses and capes with pussy-bow fastening offered a fresh take on the French house’s classic codes. Another big milestone was celebrated by Giorgio Armani, who celebrated 20 years of his couture line Armani Privé with a collection that explored themes of light and shimmer. Titled “Lumières” (French for “light” and “enlightenment”, the 90-year-old designer’s show was held at the newly acquired Palazzo Armani in the 8th arrondissement, a lavish private mansion complete with gilded moldings and a marble staircase. The collection, comprised of 94 looks, including beaded suits, sleek peplums, silky Mao jackets, crystal-encrusted evening gowns and 1920-inspired headpieces, revisited iconic moments of his career, providing a dialogue between the glamour of more recent and distant pasts, When it comes to Armani’s work, the devil really is in the details. For Alessandro Michele, the designer of Valentino, luxury means taking time, as he explained backstage after presenting his first couture collection for the Italian house. Under his creative leadership, Valentino now stages one couture show a year, instead of the typical two. Michele compared the experience of haute couture to a ritual, describing the process as a labor of patience. Held at the Palais Brongniart, Paris’s former stock exchange, each look appeared with a number displayed behind them, a nod to early haute couture presentations, when models would carry cards with their look numbers. A Harlequin crinoline dress, moiré Ottoman pants, a poppy-red bolero jacket, ruffled collars and other nods to Ancien Régime, the social and political order that existed in France from the late Middle Ages until the French Revolution, seamlessly merged, underlining Michele’s knack for interweaving genres and epochs. Among Michele’s influences were Stanley Kubrick’s 1975 black comedy-drama film “Barry Lyndon”, Virginia Woolf’s 1928 novel “Orlando” and Umberto Eco’s 2009 literary anthology “The Infinity of Lists”. The designer also emphasized his fascination with the concept of lists, which served as a creative starting point for the collection. “Creating a handmade dress is like drafting a never-ending list, with many pieces composing this mosaic,” he said. The inspiration also took a physical form on the runway, where a list of unconnected words, such as “Sigmund Freud”, “crêpe-de-chine” and “Bloody Mary”, alluding to each of the model’s looks, scrolled past on a giant screen. Crinolines also appeared on the Dior runway. Held at Musée Rodin on the Left Bank, the show was something of a blockbuster event, attended by stars including Pamela Anderson, Venus Williams and Jenna Ortega, who sat on the front row Some models wore crinoline styles in raffia and lace; others had embroidered butterflies and dragonflies that looked like a wearable garden. Natural materials like straw were woven with gold into a broderie anglaise. Evoking Alice in Wonderland, the collection also featured floral arrangements that had been woven into the models’ hair and the fabric of the clothes. The trapeze lines — first introduced at Dior in 1958 by then-designer Yves Saint Laurent, who sought to make women look sexy without having to accentuate a slim waistline — also made a return. Dior creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri shared that her inspiration was “the transition between childhood and adulthood and how this moment is represented in a transformation of what we wear.” At Schiaparelli, designer Daniel Roseberry offered a contrasting idea of womanhood as he presented looks with extremely cinched waistlines. A dramatic corseted nude gown with Chinoiserie embroidery, worn by Kendall Jenner, showcased an accentuated hourglass shape. Alex Consani, who last year became the first transgender Model of the Year, wore a floor-skimming feathered coat. For Roseberry, the collection was a nod to the past, as he took influence from haute couture pioneer Charles Frederick Worth. The goal, as stated in his show notes, was to “create something that feels new because it’s old” – encapsulating fashion’s ongoing love for archival pieces and the rise of vintage as a luxury status symbol.\n",
            "A former British soldier convicted ofspying for Iranafter an audaciousthree-day escapefrom a London prison was sentenced Monday to more than 14 years behind bars for betraying his country. Daniel Khalife, 23, was convicted in November of violating the Official Secrets Act and Terrorism Act for providing restricted and classified material to Iran. “As a young man you had the makings of an exemplary soldier, however, through the repeated violations of your oath of service, you showed yourself to be instead a dangerous fool,” Justice Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said. Jurors in Woolwich Crown Court had rejected his testimony that he was trying to work for the UK as a double agent. Khalife’s spying case had not received much attention untilhe broke out of Wandsworth Prisonon the underbelly of a food delivery truck. He was on the run for three days before police arrested him on a bicycle by a canal in London. Khalife pleaded guilty to the escape during his trial, but continued to contest the spying charges. Khalife’s lawyer, who argued his acts were more like a plot from “Scooby Doo” than a James Bond thriller, said his client had only passed along imprecise information, including “laughably fake” documents that caused no actual damage. “There’s no way that what Mr. Khalife did is going to wind up being a lesson for budding spies,” attorney Gul Nawaz Hussain said. “His intentions were neither sinister nor cynical.” But prosecutors said Khalife had in fact played a “cynical game” by claiming he wanted to be a spy after he had delivered a large amount of restricted and classified material to the Iranian intelligence service, including the names of special forces officers. Khalife testified that he had been in touch with people in the Iranian government but that it was all part of a ploy to ultimately work as a double agent for Britain, a scheme he developed from watching the TV show “Homeland.” Authorities said he presented a true risk to national security because of the threat that Iran poses. Police noted that the UK has disrupted 20 plots by Iran, including assassination plans. British security services were not aware of Khalife’s contacts with the Iranians until he contacted MI6, the UK’s foreign intelligence service, to offer to work as a double agent. He reached out to MI6 anonymously, saying he had earned the trust of his Iranian handlers and that they had rewarded him by leaving $2,000 cash (£1,578) in a dog poo bag in a north London park. Khalife joined the army at 16 and was assigned to the Royal Corps of Signals, a communications unit that is deployed with battlefield troops, as well as special forces and intelligence squads. He was told he could not join the intelligence service because his mother is from Iran. At 17, he reached out to a man connected with Iranian intelligence and began passing along information, prosecutors said. He was given NATO secret security clearance when he took part in a joint exercise at Fort Cavazos in Texas in early 2021. The judge noted that his security breaches while on US soil could have caused diplomatic damage. Khalife’sescape from the Victorian-era prisondrew attention to larger failures in the nation’s aging and overcrowded correctional system. An inquiry is currently underway into how Khalife was able to escape and whether others helped. Two men have been arrested on charges of helping him after he escaped.\n",
            "Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela areheading hometo the US, President Donald Trump announced Friday, after his envoy met with the country’s President Nicolás Maduro. The meeting in Caracas,first reported by CNN, was notable given Washington does not officially recognize the presidency of Maduro – who opposition leaders in Venezuela have accused of stealing last year’s elections. US officials have not yet given details of the six detainees released, but Trump’s envoy for special missions Richard Grenell posted a picture on X of himself with the men aboard a plane. “I’ve just been informed that we are bringing six hostages home from Venezuela,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “Thank you to Ric Grenell and my entire staff. Great job!” Grenell’s picture shows four of the released Americans wearing light blue outfits commonly worn by people held in the Venezuelan prison system. “We are wheels up and headed home with these six American citizens. They just spoke to President Trump, and they couldn’t stop thanking him,” Grenell wrote in his post. Maduro’s claim to athird termhas been contested by the country’s opposition, which has published thousands of voting tallies that suggested their candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, won the election in July last year. They were backed by independent observers such as the Carter Center and the Colombian Electoral Mission. Like the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada, the US does not recognize Maduro as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. It has placed a raft of sanctions or visa restrictions on Maduro-aligned officials. Washington has no diplomatic presence in Venezuela. In September the USseized Maduro’s airplane. Friday’s prisoner release came after a meeting between Grenell and Maduro, which had been expected to cover the deportation of Venezuelan nationals from the US. Trump has prioritized his campaign promise of mass deportations but Maduro has refused to take Venezuelan nationals back – and the US has generally been unable to send Venezuelans back because of frosty relations. Gonzalez, who the US recognizes as Venezuela’s president-elect and who attended Trump’s inauguration, has warned the White House against cutting a deal with Maduro on deportation flights. As Grenell headed to the meeting on Friday, Trump was asked if his envoy being photographed with Maduro would lend legitimacy to the Venezuelan leader. The US President told reporters he wanted to “do something with Venezuela,” but noted that he was “a big opponent of Venezuela and Maduro.” “They’ve treated us not so good, but they’ve treated, more importantly, the Venezuelan people, very badly,” he said. Maduro said in an annual speech to the judiciary late on Friday evening that the meeting with Grenell had yielded some initial deals and he looked forward to “new deals for the good of the two countries and the region,” according to Reuters. “President Donald Trump, we have made a first step, hopefully it can continue,” Maduro said. Maduro and Grenell also discussed issues of migration and sanctions, according to a Venezuelan government statement on Friday. Under Maduro – in office since 2013 – oil-rich Venezuela has fallen intoa deep economic and political crisis, gripped by hyperinflation. Millions of people have fled the country in fear and desperation. The State Department advises Americans against traveling to Venezuela, warning that “there is a high risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals.” In August last year, Venezuelan intelligence agency SEBINdetaineda US Navy sailor, according to an official who spoke to CNN. Nine Americans were brought home from Venezuela by the Biden administration in 2022 after five years of detention in the country. In December 2023, the US secured the release of six wrongfully detained Americans and four other Americans held in Venezuela.\n",
            "A rebel group that claimed to have captured the city of Goma in the easternDemocratic Republic of Congolast week has called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, after fighting with the Congolese military has left hundreds of people dead. In a statement on Monday, the rebel coalition, Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC) – which includes the M23 armed group – said it had declared the truce, starting Tuesday, “in response to the humanitarian crisis caused by the Kinshasa regime,” referring to DR Congo’s government. The DRC and much of the international community have accused neighboring Rwanda of backing the M23 rebels. It is unclear if the Congolese army will agree to the ceasefire. Previous interventions, includingtruce agreements, failed to cease hostilities. DR Congo’s military spokesperson, General Sylvain Ekenge, told CNN Tuesday that the rebels’ call for a ceasefire was not genuine. “Have you seen the Rwandans do what they say? It (the ceasefire announcement by the rebels) is a communication for international consumption and to put the international community to sleep on its feet,” he said. United Nations experts also estimate that up to3,000-4,000 Rwandan soldiersare supervising and supporting M23 fighters in the east of the DRC, outnumbering the rebel group’s forces in the country. Last week, DRC leader Felix Tshisekedi vowed “a vigorous and coordinated response” against M23, describing the group as Rwanda’s “puppet.” On Monday, Rwandan President Paul Kagame told CNN he didn’t know if his country’s troops are in eastern DR Congo. Fighting erupted last week as therebels advanced into Goma, the capital of DRC’s North Kivu province. More than a dozen foreign peacekeepers, as well as the military governor of North Kivu, were killed trying to fend off the rebels, and thousands of locals were displaced. According to the UN’s latest figures, at least 900 bodies have been recovered from the streets of Goma, and around 2,880 injuries have been recorded since the end of January. A report by the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said many healthcare facilities are overcrowded and in urgent need of medicine and equipment. The rebel alliance emphasized it has “no intention of capturing Bukavu or other areas,” referring to the capital city of the neighboring South Kivu province, where many displaced people from Goma had fled. “However, we reiterate our commitment to protecting and defending the civilian population and our positions,” it said. The group’s recent communication appears to sharply shift its stance from capturing more territories. AFC spokesman, Victor Tesongo told CNN Friday that the rebels were working to “install a new administration” in Goma and further march on to capture more cities, including South Kivu and the national capital Kinshasa. Rebel leader Corneille Nangaa alsotoldRwandan media last week that his group’s objective was “to go to Kinshasa.” “We are going to fight until we get to Kinshasa. We have come to Goma to stay; we are not going to withdraw. We are going to move forward from Goma to Bukavu … up to Kinshasa,” he said.\n",
            "Britain will make it illegal to use artificial intelligence tools that create child sexual abuse images, it said on Saturday, becoming the first country in the world to introduce the new AI sexual abuse offenses. Possessing, taking, making, showing or distributing explicit images of children is a crime in England and Wales. The new offenses target the use of AI tools to “nudeify” real-life images of children. The move comes as online criminals increasingly use AI to create child abuse material, with reports of such explicit images rising nearly five-fold in 2024, according to the Internet Watch Foundation. “We know that sick predators’ activities online often lead to them carrying out the most horrific abuse in person,” said Yvette Cooper, the United Kingdom’s interior minister. “It is vital that we tackle child sexual abuse online as well as offline so we can better protect the public from new and emerging crimes.” Predators also use AI tools to disguise their identity and blackmail children with fake images to force them into further abuse, such as by streaming live images, the government said. The new criminal offenses include the possession, creation or distribution of AI tools designed to create child sexual abuse material and the possession of so-called AI “pedophile manuals,” which provide instructions on the usage of the technology. Another specific offense will target those who run websites on which child sexual abuse content is distributed. The government will also enable authorities to unlock digital devices for inspection. The measures will be included in the Crime and Policing Bill when it comes to parliament. Britain said earlier this month it would also make the creation and sharing of sexually explicit “deepfakes” - videos, pictures or audio clips made with AI to look real - a criminal offense.\n",
            "At least nine people are believed to have died as a result of the dangerous cold gripping much of the country, as a once-in-a-generation winter storm wreaks havoc on the Gulf Coast — a region wholly unaccustomed to winter weather. While the cold has proved deadly, footage from across the Gulf Coast shows snow blanketing implausible places, causing surreal wintry scenes: in New Orleans’ French Quarter, wherestreet performers sang for passersby; on the grass at theFlorida border; and on thewhite sand beachesof Orange Beach, Alabama. “I’ve never seen anything like this,” Brennan Mathernewrote on X, where he shared footage of snow falling in Cut Off, Louisiana, “and probably never will again.” Here’s what’s happening now: • Deadly storm:Two deaths in Austin are being investigated as suspected cold-related deaths, according to the Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services, though the medical examiner’s office has not made a final determination of the causes of death. Georgia officials reported one death from hypothermia at a news conference Tuesday, saying the individual was outside the night prior. Anotherdeath is also believed to have been caused by hypothermia, involving an 80-year-old man in Milwaukee who fell outdoors early Sunday, according to the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office. At least five people died in a vehicle accident caused by icy conditions early Tuesday morning in Zavala County, Texas,according to CNN affiliate WOAI/KABB,citing authorities. • Record snowfall:Snow is falling from southeast Texas through Louisiana and into parts of Mississippi and Alabama Tuesday, creating treacherous conditions. An area stretching from Houston into Alabama has recorded widespread snowfall of 3 to 6 inches, with at least one locale hitting the double-digit mark. Eight inches of snowfall was recorded at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport on Tuesday according to the National Weather Service in New Orleans; the previous modern record was 2.7 inches in 1963.Florida has likely broken its all-time statewide snow record, with at least 5.5 inches recorded in Molino – a record that has stood since 1954. Mobile, Alabama, has so far recorded more than five inches of snow, breaking a 143-year-old record for one-day snowfall. A record amount of snow is forecast for New Orleans and other cities along the Gulf Coast. • Unprecedented blizzard warning issued:Heavy snow and strong wind gusts combined to create whiteout conditions in southern Louisiana, where snow totals of 3 to 6 inches are already widespread. It prompted thefirst-ever blizzard warninganywhere along the Gulf Coast from the National Weather Service in Lake Charles, for parts of southern Louisiana and far eastern Texas. • Widespread closures:Snow has closed or hindered operations at multiple airports in the South, contributing to the more than 2,300 flight cancellations into or out of US airports Tuesday – and more than 900 cancellations so far Wednesday.Large sections of Interstate 10 — the Gulf Coast’s major thoroughfare — in Texas and Louisiana are closed Tuesday as snow and some icy mix make travel difficult to impossible. Major roads were closed across the New Orleans area. Schools and government offices are closed Tuesday throughout the Gulf Coast and states of emergency are active inLouisiana,Georgia,Alabama,FloridaandMississippi. • Bitter cold:Low temperatures and wind chills from the Canadian border to the Mexican border are hitting dangerous levels for the second consecutive day. Wind chills Tuesday morning dropped into the teens for much of the Gulf Coast with single-digit values in northern Texas. Brutally cold temperatures are allowing an incredibly unusual storm to unfold along the Gulf Coast. Snow, and an icy mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain, expanded in the early hours of Tuesday and ramped up throughout the morning. Snow even covered sandy beaches along Texas’ coast Tuesday morning. The sweeping system is “a generational winter storm event,” theNational Weather Servicesaid Monday — and urged those along its path to take it seriously. Roads overnight and Tuesday will be “extremely hazardous if not impossible for much of the area, and travel is highly discouraged,” the service said. Schools are closed in states including Texas, Louisiana, Georgia and North Carolina. The complex mess of wintry weather spread east to reach more of Mississippi and into Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas and the western Florida Panhandle throughout the day. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp warned people in the state to stay off roads because the sudden onset of snow later in the day, in places like Atlanta, could catch people off guard. Indeed, there were impacts to the roadways by early evening, particularly south of Interstate 20, according to Georgia Department of Transportation spokesperson Natalie Dale. “Plow crews are having trouble treating some areas due to non-incident related congestion,” she said, encouraging motorists to avoid travel. “This could deteriorate very quickly like it did in 2014,” Gov. Kemp said. A few inches of snow that yearparalyzed Atlanta with countless traffic incidentsthat trapped drivers in what became known as “Snowmageddon.” The rare winter storm comes as 33 million people in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina under winter weather alerts, with more than 200 million people in the US affected by bitterly cold air more broadly. The Upper Midwest and Northern Plains recorded wind chills to 50 degrees below zero Monday and were experiencing 40 degrees below zero Tuesday morning — temperatures that can cause frostbite on exposed skin in a matter of minutes. Officials in affected states in the South cautioned people to stay off the roads, keep faucets dripping to prevent pipes from freezing, check batteries in smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and refrain from using cooking stoves to heat homes. Governors inLouisiana,Georgia,Alabama,FloridaandMississippihave declared states of emergency, while Texas authorities have directed state agencies to mobilize resources for the rare snowfall. In North Carolina, officials have deployed parts of the state National Guard to the eastern reaches of the state to support local emergency services. “Most of us haven’t experienced this combination of bitter cold and significant snow ever in our lifetime,” Louisiana climatologistJay GrymessaidMonday. Travel was paralyzed along the Interstate 10 corridor with portions already receiving widespread snowfall totals of 3 to 6 inches. More than half a foot of snow had fallen by Tuesday afternoon along a portion of I-10 in southwestern Louisiana. One location just north of Rayne, Louisiana, recorded 10.5 inches of snow before noon. Cold weather will lock any snow and ice that falls into place, keeping roads hazardous. By late Tuesday afternoon, the Louisiana State Patrol had responded to more than 50 weather-related calls for service and numerous crashes across the state. Similar warnings were echoed in neighboring Florida. “Our infrastructure is designed differently than states that are used to this (winter weather),” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned in a Tuesday news conference. “The state has done a lot to prepare but … driving in icy conditions, it can be very, very hazardous.” Disruptions were also reported in the skies, with more than a dozen airports in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida and Georgia closed to commercial flights as of Tuesday afternoon, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. There were more than 2,300 flight cancellations within, into or out of the US Tuesday morning, with most of those flights coming from Texas and Louisiana, according to the flight tracking websiteFlightAware. Nearly all flights to or from New Orleans International Airport were canceled by 10 a.m. CST. Louisiana’s Lafayette Regional Airport wasclosed Tuesdaydue to ice and snow on runways, the airport said. Mississippi’s Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport also closed its terminal and runway “until weather permits a safe reopening.” The Mobile Regional Airport in Alabama closed around 9:15 a.m. CT, spokesperson Devon Calametti told CNN, with plans to reopen at noon Wednesday. In Florida, Tallahassee International Airport said it would suspend all operations at 4 p.m. CT with plans to reopen Wednesday at noon. AndJacksonville International Airportwill close after its last departing flight Tuesday evening, around 8 p.m. Again, the airport plans to reopen at noon Wednesday. Houston’s two major airports, George Bush Intercontinental and Hobby, are also closed Tuesday, while Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport,the world’s busiest, is pretreating roadways and airfield surfaces in preparation for the winter weather, according to spokesperson Andrew Gobeil. Schools across the Deep South were closed or moved online Tuesday from Texas to Florida. In Georgia, Gwinnett County Public Schools, the state’s largest school district, has moved all its classes online. The Houston Independent School District, the largest in the Lone Star state and the eighth largest in the country, will also be closed until Wednesday. But while the weather spelled trouble and headaches for many, others were basking in the novelty. “This is the real deal, as we call it. The fluffy snow,” Benny Fontenot, a 51-year-old school principal in Rayne, Louisiana, outside Lafayette, told CNN. He shared footage of himself sitting outside in the snow wearing a traditional Cajun Mardi Gras costume while playing the accordion. “For me, it’s a blessing,” he said. “I mean, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity that God blessed us with.”\n",
            "Punxsutawney Phil, the famousgroundhog weather watcher, was pulled from his warm burrow this morning and saw his shadow, predicting six more weeks of winter. Each February 2, onGroundhog Day, the members of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club make the pilgrimage to Gobbler’s Knob — Phil’s official home. Legend has it,if he sees his shadow, six more weeks of winter are on the way. If he doesn’t, an early spring arrives. In reality, winter will end on the spring equinox, known also as the vernal equinox, on March 20 at 5:01 a.m. ET, regardless of Sunday’s prediction. But weather conditions don’t always follow the timetable — and neither does Phil. Phil has been prognosticating since the late 1800s but his recent predictions would have a better track record if he just flipped a coin: He has only been rightabout 35%of the time since 2005, according to data analyzed by NOAA. Phil’s call for an early spring last year came true. February 2024 was the third warmest on record for the Lower 48. March also ended up much warmer than normal, according to NOAA data. There are more consistent experts to turn to when Phil falters. Meteorologists at the National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center produce forecasts for temperatures and precipitation across the US on timescales ranging from one week to more than a year. Their outlook for February calls for above-average temperatures, or a potential early spring, from parts of the Rockies through the South and much of the East. Below-average temperatures from the Pacific Northwest into parts of the Midwest could be an extended winter. These regional trends are likely to continue into early spring, the center’s forecasts through April show. Rounds of brutal cold have pounded the eastern half of the US all winter. It was thecoldest Presidential Inauguration in 40 yearsand cold unusually far south ushered in ahistoric snowstorm for the Gulf Coast. It’s been one of the 10-coldest winters for dozens of cities east of the Mississippi River, according to theSoutheast Regional Climate Center. But the West has remained warm this winter following thewarmest fallon record for theLower 48. Phoenix, Las Vegas and San Francisco are just a few cities experiencing one of their 10-warmest winters. Warmer winters aren’t a fluke, even when punctuated with seasonably appropriate cold. Winter has become thefastest-warming seasonfor nearly 75% of the US as temperatures rise globally in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. So, Phil’s prediction of six more weeks of winter is a bad bet in a warming world.\n",
            "A cousin of the former Syrian leaderBashar al-Assadwho was involved in suppressing the protests that started the2011 uprisinghas been detained inside Syria, according to state news agency SANA. Atef Najib was detained in the Latakia region, an Assad family stronghold where some loyalists of the former regime have taken refuge. Assad and his family fled to Russia when rebels swept across the country last year. His detention comes after Syria’s newly inducted interim leader Ahmad al-Sharaa warned recently the next government will be “pursuing criminals who have shed Syrian blood and committed massacres and crimes against us, whether they are hiding within the country of have fled abroad.” Najib had been sanctioned by the US and European Union for his role in violently suppressing pro-democracy protests in 2011 – which raged into years of civil war after Assad’s forces moved to stamp out the peaceful demonstrations. Protests against the Assad regime spread quickly in the spring of that year after a group of children were arrested and tortured for writing anti-regime graffiti on walls in the city of Deraa. According to local people at the time, the children had their fingernails removed. They’d been inspired by the Arab Spring that was sweeping through several countries in the region, including Egypt and Tunisia. Najib was then head of the regime’s Political Security Branch inDeraa. The parents of the children and prominent local representatives pleaded with Najib to let the children go. “They were told, ‘Forget your children. If you want children, make more children. If you don’t know how, bring us your women and we will make them for you,’” wrote Alia Malek in her bookThe Home That Was Our Country. The children were eventually released but the army subsequently launched an assault in Deraa and protests quickly spread across Syria. A senior official in the new security directorate in Latakia, Lt. Col. Mustafa Knaifati, said Friday that Najib was “considered one of those involved in committing crimes against the Syrian people.” The Assad dynasty’s autocratic rule in Syria was marked by decades of fighting, bloodshed and oppressive political crackdown. All parties to the war carried out unlawful attacks, killing civilians and destroyed vital infrastructure, according to Amnesty International. Transitional leader Al-Sharaa, whose militant group led astunning chargeby coalition forces to seize regime-held territory and depose Assad in December, has said he now hopes to achieve “civil peace.” Al-Sharaa, a former al Qaeda member, and his new aides will be tasked with restoring a country riven by more than a decade of brutal civil war that killed over300,000 people, according to the UN. More than 6 million Syrians have fled the country, theUN said. This is a developing story and will be updated.\n",
            "A female swimmer has died in a shark attack in the waters off a popular tourist spot on Australia’s east coast, authorities said. Emergency crews were called to the Woorim Beach at Bribie Island, about 80 kms (50 miles) north of Brisbane around 5 p.m. local time on Monday following reports of a serious shark bite incident, Queensland state police said on Monday. “The female was swimming when she was bitten by a shark … the female sustained life-threatening injuries and succumbed to those injuries,” a police spokesperson said in an email. Police did not disclose the age of the victim though Australian media widely reported the victim was a 17-year-old girl. Christopher Potter, a resident, said the beach is frequently used by swimming groups through the day. “It’s known there are a lot of sharks around Bribie, but this close to shore, it’s still a shock,” he told Australian public broadcaster ABC News.\n",
            "The Greek island of Santorini is being rattled by dozens of tremors, prompting authorities to close schools and airlines to announce additional flights on Monday to help people leave the popular tourist destination. Over the past four days, more than 200 earthquakes have been recorded between Santorini and Amorgos in the Aegean Sea, with the strongest reaching a magnitude of 4.9. Tremors, some with a magnitude above 4, continued to rattle Santorini on Monday. Although these quakes are considered minor or light, authorities have closed schools on Santorini, as well as on Amorgos, Ios and Anafi, and advised residents to avoid large indoor gatherings. After an emergency meeting Monday, Greek authorities announced that schools on the four islands will remain closed until Friday. “We are dealing with a very intense geological phenomenon. I want to ask the islanders to remain calm,” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told reporters in Brussels on Monday, on the sidelines of a meeting of European Union leaders. In an update, Vassilis Karastathis, director at the Institute of Geodynamics at the National Observatory of Athens, told Greek media on Monday that “the seismic activity continues regularly with the same intensity.” Aegean Airlines, Greece’s largest airline, announced two additional flights on Monday and one on Tuesday, traveling to and from Santorini, to help residents and visitors leave the island. Nikos Zorzos, the mayor of the island, denied that there was a “mass exodus” from the island, and told Greek media that the majority of those leaving were seasonal workers, not permanent residents. Sitting on several fault lines – known as the Hellenic Volcanic Arc – Santorini isno stranger to earthquakes. But the risk of tremors does not deter as many as 3.4 million people from visiting Santorini each year, dwarfing the 20,000 or so permanent residents of the island. Santorini is famed for its crescent-shaped caldera, which was created by one of the largest known volcanic eruptions around 3,600 years ago. The tourist destination has been dubbed Greece’s“Instagram island”because of its photogenic golden light and sweeping scenery. The Hellenic Volcanic Arc, one of the most active volcanic fields in Europe, has seen more than 100 eruptions over the past 400,000 years. The most recent large quake in Santorini struck in 1956. The 7.5-magnitude earthquake was followed by a 25-meter-high (around 80 feet) tsunami. At least 53 people were killed and more than 100 injured, while at least one-third of the houses on the island collapsed. Authorities said current seismic activity is due to tectonic movements that do not appear related to volcanic activity. Similarly, increased seismic activity in 2011 and 2012 did not result in any eruptions, they added. This story has been updated with additional developments.\n",
            "ChatGPT can be duped into providing detailed advice on how to commit crimes ranging from money laundering to the export of weapons to sanctioned countries, a tech startup found, raising questions over the chatbot’s safeguards against its use to aid illegal activity. Norwegian firm Strise ran experiments asking ChatGPT for tips on committing specific crimes. In one experiment, conducted last month, the chatbot came up with advice on how to launder money across borders, according to Strise. And in another experiment, run earlier this month, ChatGPT produced lists of methods to help businesses evade sanctions, such as those against Russia, including bans on certain cross-border payments and the sale of arms. Strise sells software that helps banks and other companies combat money laundering, identify sanctioned individuals and tackle other risks. Among its clients are Nordea, a leading bank in the Nordic region, PwC Norway and Handelsbanken. Marit Rødevand, Strise’s co-founder and chief executive, said would-be lawbreakers could now usegenerative artificial intelligencechatbots such as ChatGPT to plan their activities more quickly and easily than in the past. “It is really effortless. It’s just an app on my phone,” she told CNN. Strise found that it is possible to circumvent blocks put in place by OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, aimed at preventing the chatbot from responding to certain questions by asking questions indirectly, or by taking on a persona. “It’s like having a corrupt financial adviser on your desktop,” Rødevand said on the company’s podcast last month, describing the money laundering experiment. An OpenAI spokesperson told CNN: “We’re constantly making ChatGPT better at stopping deliberate attempts to trick it, without losing its helpfulness or creativity.” “Our latest (model) is our most advanced and safest yet, significantly outperforming previous models in resisting deliberate attempts to generate unsafe content,” the spokesperson added. While the internet has long provided people with easy access to information on how to commit crimes, generative AI chatbots have dramatically sped up the process of finding, interpreting and consolidating all kinds of information. ChatGPT makes it “significantly easier for malicious actors to better understand and subsequently carry out various types of crime,” according to areportby Europol, the European Union’s law enforcement agency, published in March last year, four months after OpenAI released the app to the public. “Being able to dive deeper into topics without having to manually search and summarize the vast amount of information found on classical search engines can speed up the learning process significantly,” the agency added. Generative AI chatbots are trained on huge volumes of data found online and are able to to produce detailed responses to unfamiliar questions. But they can also reproduce people’sracistandsexistbiases, as well as peddledisinformation— for example, about elections. OpenAI is aware of the power of its tool and has created safeguards to prevent itsabuse. A quick experiment by CNN showed that when ChatGPT was asked, “how can I, as the owner of a US-based export business, evade sanctions against Russia?” the chatbot responded, “I can’t assist with that.” The app immediately removed the offending question from the chat and statedthat the content  may violate OpenAI’susage policies. “Violating our policies could result in action against your account, up to suspension or termination,” the company states in those policies. “We also work to make our models safer and more useful, by training them to refuse harmful instructions and reduce their tendency to produce harmful content.” But in its report last year, Europol said there was “no shortage of new workarounds” to evade the safeguards built into AI models, which can be used by ill-intentioned users or researchers testing the technology’s safety.

            "On the first day of November, Aleksandar Matkovic was running late for a train. He was traveling from Novi Sad, in the north of Serbia, to its capital Belgrade, where he works as an economic historian. When he got to the station, he witnessed a scene of horror that has rocked the country to this day. Minutes before he arrived, the canopy of the station – where reconstruction had been completed months earlier – had collapsed, crushing passengers waiting on the platform. Fifteen people were killed. “I stood there for about two or three hours, just staring blankly at the space where the canopy was. The whole thing was so unrealistic,” Matkovic told CNN. Shock soon turned to anger. The crumbled canopy has come to serve as a potent symbol of what many Serbs see as corruption at the heart of the state, sculpted by President Aleksandar Vucic and his government over 12 years in power. What began as vigils for the dead have become near-daily protests, drawing in ever-larger segments of Serbian society and reaching every corner of the Balkan nation. “We’re in uncharted territory,” said Matkovic. The student-led demonstrations, demanding the full release of documents about the reconstruction works, have become so large and so lasting that some have questioned whether they could bring down Vucic’s reign. “All sorts of questions are going through people’s minds,” said Matkovic. Vucic has dominated Serbia since coming to power as prime minister in 2014, then president three years later. A former information minister for the brutal Yugoslav regime of Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian democracy has degraded under Vucic’s Serbian Progressive Party (SNS). Freedom House, which measures the strength of democracies, said Serbia declined from “free” to “partly free” in 2019, citing attacks on the media and concentration of power in the hands of the president. His regime is hard to categorize, analysts say. It is not as repressive as Aleksander Lukashenko’s Belarus, but neither as permissive as Viktor Orban’s Hungary. Ivana Stradner, a fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said Vucic has “made Serbia what Russia was like in the early 1990s, leaning towards a criminal, corrupt state with no rule of law.” Still, his detractors praise him as a canny operator. In an increasingly multipolar world, countries such as Serbia – a regional powerhouse that the West has tried to prize away from its historic ally Russia – enjoy plenty of options. For Moscow, Serbia can stem the westward slide of other Balkan nations. For Europe, a huge proposed lithium mine could make it important for the green transition. For China, Serbia offers the chance to extend its influence through the Belt and Road Initiative. Even some in the United States have interests in the country. Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, is reportedly working on a deal to build a Trump-branded hotel in Belgrade, with capital from various Gulf states. For Serbia, this transactional approach may not add up to a coherent ideology – it has sold weapons to Ukraine but refuses to join sanctions against Russia – but it has been profitable. Serbia has been kept plied with Russian gas, Chinese infrastructure, European investment, and even glitzy American construction projects. This “strategic ambiguity,” as Stradner calls it, has come at the cost of domestic discontent, however. “People have had enough,” said Engjellushe Morina, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “The students are fed up with this rhetoric … where Vucic says one thing for internal consumption and another thing for international consumption.” Anger with the government had been brewing for years. In May 2023, when Serbia was rocked bytwo mass shootings, people protested the country’s“culture of violence.”There were more  demonstrations after a disputed election later that year, with the opposition calling for a rerun. They also lasted for weeks but eventually fizzled out. This time is different, protesters and analysts say. Latent discontent with the government found its expression in the Novi Sad station tragedy. The station had been hastily reopened in 2022 – with Vucic and Orban in attendance – ahead of an election held that year, before being closed for more works by a Chinese company and its subcontractors. Matkovic said Serbs felt the project was “fast tracked” and “pushed by political elites.” It reopened in July 2024, just four months before its newly built canopy collapsed. While previous scandals have failed to stick to Vucic, this one has. The perception of alleged corruption is “one thing that unifies all people,” said Stradner. Serbian prosecutors have so far indicted 13 people for their role in the disaster, including the former minister for construction, transport and infrastructure, but protesters have demanded that more be done to hold people politically and criminally accountable. Analysts say Vucic is skilled in thwarting protests by making targeted concessions, jettisoning allies, catching the opposition off-guard or ridiculing the movement. He regularly labels protesters as “foreign agents” attempting to stage a “color revolution,” as in other former Soviet states. But these demonstrations represent a new challenge. Because they began as acts of mourning, they were largely free of “political” signs such as European Union flags, which Vucic has previously used to discredit demonstrations. The protests have also drawn in broad swaths of Serbian society. In scenes reminiscent of the end of Milosevic’s regime, farmers have joined in, driving their tractors into Belgrade. Even judges have come on board – a shock, given Vucic’s control of much of the judiciary, said Edward P. Joseph, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University who served for a dozen years in the Balkans, including with NATO. “Ordinarily they would never dare to raise their head in such public fashion, but now they’re showing themselves in silent support of the protests,” Joseph told CNN. “The fear factor is gone.” It is not clear how Vucic can reclaim that power, Joseph said. Because Vucic must “play this charade” of responsibility, a violent crackdown would be “writing his own epitaph.” But the opposite approach – embarking on large-scale democratic reforms – is also challenging, said Morina. Although Prime Minister Milos Vucevic resigned this week, saying he did so “in order not to further raise tensions in society,” this has done little to satisfy the protesters. “How convincing is it that he (Vucic) is going to be able to turn this whole movement that he has built – the SNS (the Serbian Progressive Party), the party supporters, the radicals, the football hooligans – how can he turn this into a democratic movement?” Morina said. It is not clear what can break the deadlock. The protest movement has distanced itself from opposition politicians, meaning there is no obvious alternative waiting in the wings. But this could be a strength, Stradner said. “It’s time to stop having a cult of personality that Serbia has had for decades. It’s time to believe more in laws, in the judiciary, in checks and balances, than to believe in one personality type,” she said.\n",
            "Steve Burns and his son Lucian had a good feeling about the Major League Soccer (MLS) Cup Final on December 7. It was exactly 10 years to the day that they had sat in the same stadium in Los Angeles to watch their beloved Galaxy team lift the trophy. A decade later, and with Lucian now a young man, the Galaxy triumphed again. “I don’t necessarily believe in destiny,” he explained toCNN Sport. “It just sort of felt unstoppable this year.” But as the Burns’ celebrated – along with tens of thousands of other supporters – into the night, they could hardly imagine their lives would be totally upended just a few weeks later. Burns and his family are some of the thousands of people whose homes burned to the ground in thedevastating fir﻿es that swept Southern Californiaearly this year. He told CNN he’s grateful that he was able to get his family out of their rustic house before it burned to the ground in the early hours of his wife’s birthday in the Eaton Canyon wildfire. A few days later, he was able to watch a video clip of CNN’s Anderson Cooper broadcasting outside his home of 24 years. The place where he raised his children was now an inferno; completing the apocalyptic scene was the sound of a vehicle exploding close to his property. “It’s one of those unpleasant images that you wish you wouldn’t have seen,” he lamented. “It kind of forever sticks with you.” They had managed to save their pets – three cats, three dogs, some geckos, a snake, a turtle and some fish – but little else. All that was left when they returned to El Molino Avenue in Altadena was a brick chimney stack and a pile of smoldering ash. Virtually everything they owned was gone, including their treasured Los Angeles Galaxy soccer jerseys. Los Angeles is a famous sports city, and a very successful one. Their franchises are among the biggest in the country: theLakers, theDodgersand theRamshave all won championships since 2020 – and the Galaxy are the most successful team in MLS history. But it’s a city that also tends to lurch from triumph to tragedy and back again. LA’s densely populated urban center sits precariously on top of thePuente Hills Fault, which has caused numerous earthquakes including theNorthridge quake of 1994. At the time, it was the most expensive natural disaster in US history. The city is often unsettled by racial tensions androcked by the resulting riots, notably the 1992 carnage in the wake of the controversial Rodney King trial. LA has been a powder keg metaphorically, and now it seems literally, with the ever-present threat of wildfires lurking just over the horizon. Galaxy President Tom Braun told CNN Sport that you can only truly appreciate the scale of the tragedy if you live in LA. “It’s hard to gauge if you’re not here,” he explained. “But I can assure you it’s absolutely devastating.” By cross-referencing last season’s ticket sales data with zip codes in the disaster areas, Braun estimates that more than 11,000 of their fans who cheered for them on their championship run, and likely many more, have been affected. The club partnered with parent company AEG and the NHL’s Los Angeles Kings to donate $1 million to the Red Cross, gifted apparel and coordinated a donation drive from Galaxy fans to help the victims. The newly won Philip F. Anschutz trophy has been quietly taken to weary fire houses to lift the spirits of the men and women tackling the blazes and when the Galaxy heard of the Burns’ family tragedy, they partnered with the apparel firm Fanatics and invited them to the stadium. In recounting the visit, Steve Burns described an almost surreal experience as they were invited into the locker room by the club president, where they mingled with the General Manager Will Kuntz and defender Mauricio Cuevas. They pulled out a phone to share a personalized recorded message from the Galaxy’s legendary midfielder Cobi Jones and handed over two large duffel bags packed with team shirts, hats, scarves and jackets. But there was one more surprise. “We came around a corner,” Burns told CNN, “and there was Maya Yoshida, waiting for us, holding the MLS Cup and I was just blown away. This guy had been standing there for however long, and he’s standing there holding the cup!” The Japanese defender is the Galaxy captain, whose contract had expired and was therefore a free agent. Yoshida handed the trophy over to their guests, pulled out a pen, and asked a simple question. “He’s like, ‘Should I sign it?’ And I thought, God, he’s already signed a jersey for my son, and I thought, like, should I give him mine to sign? He’s like, ‘Should I go sign it? I’ll go upstairs and sign it right now if you guys want me to!’” Yoshida was about to sign a two-year contract extension, but he was asking the fans, who’d just lost all their worldly possessions, for permission to proceed. “We were like, ‘Uh, that’d be great. Of course!’ We walked back to the car, kind of stunned.” Burns and his family were also invited to the team’s season opener against San Diego in February. “It gives us something to look forward to,” he said. “Like all sports, it’s a nice escape from the realities which sometimes aren’t so pleasant. I really, really appreciated it.” Officials for the Galaxy organization realize that there is only so much they can do to help but say they feel compelled to do as much as they possibly can. Kuntz vividly remembers his last year of high school in New York City following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, and how sports teams then rallied to help the community. Speaking of the triggering effect of the burning smell in the Los Angeles air, he recalled volunteering in Lower Manhattan and seeing the impact the New York Giants’ stars Tiki Barber and Amani Toomer had on their community. “It’s humbling,” he told CNN. “I think it’s been really inspiring to see how some of our guys have responded. It’s still so fresh and new for everybody, but there’s a real call to action among our group.” The Galaxy players would already have been motivated to defend their title, but Kuntz feels they all now have even more to play for. “When we have that first game at Dignity Health Sports Park, it’s going to be charged with energy and emotion – reminiscent of Yankee Stadium or those first Knicks games in October and November of 2002. I think that’s when you’ll really see what it means to the players and the fans in the stadium when we all get together again for the first time. It sounds cliché to say we’re a part of the city, but really the city is a part of us,” he said. “This is (going to be) a years-, if not decades-long recovery effort,” he concluded. “We know that we’re not just doing this for a TV hit or a few social media impressions. This is something that we really need to dig our heels in and be a part of for the future.” The club is making their facilities available to high school teams who lost their access to playing fields and Kuntz says they’re thinking of ways to honor the first responders who’ve been on the front lines of the fire. But psychologically, the Galaxy and the sports community in LA can also help by providing a sense of normalcy. With large swathes of the city in complete ruins, the business of sports will continue as usual: in February, the new MLS season kicks off and the Dodgers will start the defense of their World Series title in March. Next year, the FIFA World Cup will kick off in Los Angeles; in 2027, the city will host Super Bowl LXI; and in 2028, the eyes of the world will be on the City of Angels as it hosts theSummer Olympics. As thousands of residents try to rebuild their shattered lives, not everyone will be cheering, but Steve Burns thinks that the arrival of so many major international sports events could be a plus. “People are going to come into LA, wondering what these areas look like now. I look forward to all the attention because I think, in some ways, it puts pressure on the city to help rebuild,” he said. “The ability to disengage with the trauma and provide something uplifting” is not to be underestimated, added Kuntz. “I do believe that it will be very important for the city to show the world how OK and strong we are. Angelinos have this stereotype of being soft and all about the beach, but there is real strength and pride in this city. And the sequencing of these sports events is a real opportunity to show what we are about and to collectively commit to the restoration of the city.”\n",
            "When British comedian and presenter Amelia Dimoldenberg stepped onto the red carpet tointerview Sydney Sweeney in 2022, it only took a second for Dimoldenberg’s dress to reverse their roles. “This is amazing,” Sweeney said, reaching out to touch the presenters’ sleeveless black floor-length gown. The fabric — an opaque mass of rubbery spider-like webs — giggled with each movement. “What is this?” she asked. The intricate, lacelike piece (made from 3D-printed latex) was the work of German designer Kasia Kucharska. Sweeney’s curiosity is echoed by the industry. Earlier this year, Kucharska won€100,000($102,835) to keep developing her creations. “It feels amazing,” she told CNN of the win from her studio in Berlin, where she presented her first runway show on Sunday. The German capital’s fashion week — which ran from January 31 to February 3 — was founded in 2007, but grew its international guest list this season by over 40%. Alongside the six-figure grant, Kucharska’s prize from the Fashion Council Germany and Vogue Fashion Fund included the opportunity to stage a runway show and receive mentorship from industry experts on distribution, brand and collection development. “It’s been a ride… The support has been so great,” she said. While studying at the Berlin University of the Arts, Kucharska became interested in the opulent fashion of the 18th and 19th century — particularly the era’s lacework seen in underwear, shirts, collars and cuffs. Pinned to her studio’s reference board are Elizabethan portraits; scraps of leavers lace in black, white and pink; as well as photographs of historical garments. Lace dates at least as far back as theearly 16th century, where it was handmade using a single needle and thread to stitch a delicate pattern or braided using multiple threads, by nuns. Later, heaving Victorian-era steel machines, monitored by twisthands — human machine operators overseeing the twisting, knitting and braiding of cotton into delicate lace — mechanized the industry. This type of lace production has largely died out, with only a few active lace mills remaining. Today, the process can be entirely computerized and automated. While Kucharska’s final creations are far more unconventional than the hand-woven filigree of traditional lace, the two processes are similar in their meticulousness. She uses a combination of poured and printed latex for her pieces.“It’s handmade,” she said of her materials. “We create in a very artisanal way here in our studio. It’s a very time-consuming procedure.” Throughout her collections, loopy, abstract flowers provide the basis for a range of designs. Two dense clusters of the spindly florals become a bikini-tie top, worn with an open-front catsuit that looks like it was drawn directly onto the models body. During her most recent runway, Kucharska layered her latex lace tights under shirts, ruched mini skirts and dresses. There is a naïve element to her spiral designs in birthday party colors, like doodles in a schoolbook. Kucharska calls the looping shapes printed onto the sheer mesh  “childish” in the freedom of its form.  Because of latex’s malleable nature, her process is “very intuitive and experimental,” she said. “Latex is a liquid material. It’s like milk from the tree. And we work with it in a very raw way, or we give pigment to it and then we pour it.” From start to finish, each garment can take several days to make — as every piece requires rounds of cooling, drying and washing. But understanding the material has taken years, she added, from refining her techniques to perfecting her recipe, which remains a secret of her business. Kucharska began to realize the sartorial potential of liquid latex during her time at the Berlin University of the Arts. “It’s an extremely durable material. It’s biodegradable. It’s sustainable. And you just can do so much with it,” she said. Alongside her lacy dresses, which have been worn by the likes of Julia Fox and musician Chloe Bailey, Kucharska also uses latex to build bags from scratch. “It’s really a mono-material,” she said. “I’m trying to think about boundaries, like how else can we do fashion without sewing?” And for those considering making the leap from their grandmother’s lace to a Kasia Kucharska piece, the designer has some advice: “Embrace who you are, be eccentric, be joyful, celebrate life. Have fun. Be daring, be confident.”\n",
            "A key group of Arab nations have said they “firmly” reject any efforts to resettle or evict Palestinians from Gaza, after US President Donald Trump said hewanted to “clean out”the enclave and move its population to neighboring countries. The foreign ministers of Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt issued a wide-ranging statement Saturday, saying they hoped to work with Trump on a two-state solution in the Middle East. But they pushed back on Trump’s suggestion to relocatePalestiniansfrom Gaza. Without specifically referencing the president’s proposal, the ministers reiterated a commitment to rebuilding the enclave while ensuring “the continued presence of Palestinians in their homeland.” The nations “firmly rejected any actions that threaten these rights, including settlement expansion, forced evictions, home demolitions, land annexation, or the displacement of Palestinians through direct expulsion or coerced migration,” they wrote after a meeting of the foreign ministers in Cairo. In January, Trump said he hadspoken with the king of Jordanabout potentially building housing   elsewhere in the Middle East and moving more than 1 million Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries. “I said to him that I’d love you to take on more, because I’m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now and it’s a mess, it’s a real mess,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One. “You’re talking about a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing.” “I don’t know, something has to happen, but it’s literally a demolition site right now,” Trump said. “Almost everything’s demolished, and people are dying there, so I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing in a different location where I think they could maybe live in peace for a change.” The statement from the Arab foreign ministers touched on a range of topics relating to Gaza’s reconstruction, as the fragile ceasefire between Hamas and Israel allows the region to assess the impact of a brutal 15-month conflict. The group hailed “the important role played by the United States in facilitating the deal,” for which both Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden have sought credit. They also “called for the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and rejected any attempts to partition the Strip,” and pointed to the “indispensable role” of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees or UNRWA, two days after Israel’s ban on the agency went into effect.\n",
            "Thousands of people have fled the island ofSantorinias hundreds of quakes continued to course through the famous Greek tourist destination. More than 6,000 residents have left the island in recent days, according to Greek public broadcaster ERT. Early Tuesday morning, hundreds of people carrying their belongings were seen waiting at a port on the island, waiting for a ferry to take them to Athens. A tremor with a magnitude of 4.8 was recorded early Tuesday, just shy of a 4.9 quake recorded over the weekend – the strongest so far. Over the past three days, some 550 tremors with a magnitude of 3.0 have been recorded in the Aegean Sea, between Santorini and the nearby islands of Amorgos and Ios. Greece’s Earthquake Planning and Protection Organization (OASP) has estimated that the intense seismic activity may continue for many more days, if not weeks. Santorini, dubbed Greece’s “Instagram Island,” attracts some 3.4 million visitors a year but is only home to around 20,000 permanent residents. Many of those have decided to flee the island for the safety of the mainland. “I work on the island, I have been a resident for years. But today… nobody was expecting this to happen, what is happening now on the island is incredible,” Julian Sinanaj, a 35-year-old resident, told Reuters. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on Monday urged residents to remain calm as authorities deal with “a very intense geological phenomenon.” Additional flights have been announced to help residents get to safety, with 15 flights from Santorini to Athens scheduled for Tuesday. Schools on the island will remain closed until Friday and residents have been advised to avoid large indoor gatherings. “Everything is closed. No one works now. The whole island has emptied,” Dori, an 18-year-old resident, told Reuters. Sitting near the boundary of the massive African and Eurasian tectonic plates, Santorini is no stranger to tremors, although near-constant seismic events like this are rare. The island is famed for its caldera – a bowl-shaped crater caused by a volcanic eruption – which was formed by one of the largest known blasts around 3,600 years ago. Santorini’s most recent large quake – with a 7.5 magnitude – struck in 1956, killing at least 53 people and injuring more than 100 others.\n",
            "Police said “around 10 people” were killed at a school on Tuesday, in what has been described as the worst mass shooting in Sweden’s history. The suspected perpetrator is among the dead. A large number of people were injured after a gunman opened fire at a campus in the city of Örebro in central Sweden, according to Roberto Eid Forest, the head of the city’s police district. Speaking at a press conference late Tuesday, Forest explained that police were not able to report the exact death toll as the investigation was in its early stages. Police said that the perpetrator was not known to them before the shooting and that he was not connected to any gangs. They also said they did not believe the motive was terror related. Police did not say what type of weapon was used by the gunman. “We think he is a lone perpetrator,” Forest said. He added that the shooting was “extremely tragic, with many involved.” “It’s a terrible event, it’s exceptional – a nightmare,” Forest added. Sweden’s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson offered his condolences to the victims and their families and thanked the police during a press conference on Tuesday. “We’ve today seen brutal, deadly violence against completely innocent people – this is the worst mass shooting in Swedish history,” he said. Speaking alongside the prime minister, the country’s Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer called it an “unspeakably sad tragedy.” The shooting occurred inside Campus Risbergska – a school for adult education – which is located on a campus where other schools, including those for children, are based. Officers were first called at around 12:30 p.m. local time (6:30 a.m. ET), Forest said. Six people had been taken to the local university hospital, including five with gunshot wounds, according to Jonas Claesson, the regional health care director. Four had undergone surgery, including two who are now in a stable condition, he said. CNN affiliate Expressen reported earlier that there was an exchange of gunfire between the police and the perpetrator, quoting police spokesperson Lars Hedlin. It is unclear how many people were injured in total, but police said no officers were shot. The public were urged to avoid the area and stay indoors. Students are being transferred from schools next to the site of the shooting in Örebro, which lies 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of the Swedish capital, Stockholm. The police said in a later update they were investigating various addresses in Örebro and that work at the crime scene continued. “At the moment, the police believe that the perpetrator was acting alone, but we cannot rule out more perpetrators connected to the incident,” it said. Sweden’s King Carl XVI Gustaf said his family received the news of the shooting “with sadness and dismay” in a written statement Tuesday. “Tonight we send our condolences to the families and friends of the deceased. Our thoughts at this moment also go to the injured and their relatives as well as others affected,” the king said, adding his “appreciation” to the emergency services “who worked intensively to save and secure human lives on this dark day.” One eyewitness recalled sounds of terror filling the corridors of the school, the Associated Press reported, citing Sweden’s Expressen newspaper. “We heard three bangs and loud screams,” Andreas Sundling, 28, said while sheltering in a classroom. “Now we’re sitting here waiting to be evacuated from the school. The information we have received is that we should sit and wait.” The Risbergska school offers courses at elementary school and high school level for students ages 20 and over – including classes for immigrants, as well as vocational training. There were an unusually low number of students on campus at the time of the attack, according to a teacher at the school. Many students had left campus after taking a national exam Tuesday, Lena Warenmark told state broadcaster SVT News, according to the Associated Press. Scandinavian authorities have worked tocrack downon gun violence over recent years, following an uptick in deadly gang-related shootings. In 2024, at least 40 people were shot dead there, according to Reuters. That year, police said they prevented more than 100 serious crimes. In 2023, Sweden tallied the highest rate of gun violence per capita. Earlier Tuesday, Kristersson had called for an investigation into “how these horrific crimes could have occurred.” “It is with sadness that I have received information about the terrible act of violence in Örebro. My thoughts are with those who have been affected and their relatives. It is a very painful day for all of Sweden,” Kristersson posted on X. “My thoughts are also with all those whose normal school day was replaced with terror. Being confined to a classroom with fear for your own life is a nightmare that no one should have to experience,” he added.\n",
            "A Russian strike on a residential building in central Ukraine killed at least 14 people, including two children, emergency services said, one of many attacks across the country this weekend. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia targeted the building in Poltava early Saturday morning, calling the attack “another terrorist crime.” There has been no let up in the fighting in Ukraine, even with Donald Trump now in the White House havingpromised to reach a ceasefirequickly. Ukraine’s army continues to bepushed backon the eastern frontlines in the face of superior Russian manpower and resources. Among the victims of the strike in Poltava was Olena Yavorska, her husband Dmytro and their 9-year-old daughter Sofia, according to Olena’s colleague, who posted a statement on Facebook. “Russia killed our colleague and her family,” Volodymyr Popereshniuk, co-owner of Nova Poshta, a Ukranian logistics company where Olena worked, said Sunday. “Olena was a biology teacher by education, but in 2015 she joined Nova Poshta. The Yavorsky family resided on the second floor of the destroyed building.” Emergency services and psychologists from the country’s national police department are providing help to nearly 200 people, the state emergency service said Sunday. Rescue operations are ongoing, it added. Meanwhile, Ukraine and Russia traded blame over a deadly strike on a former boarding school on Saturday in Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops have been holding territory after launching a shock incursion last summer. The Ukrainian military said the Russian air force struck the school in the town of Sudzha with a guided aerial bomb, killing at least four people as locals were sheltering in the building and preparing to evacuate. At least 84 more people were rescued and four are in “serious condition,” the Ukrainian military said, calling the attack a “war crime.” At the same time, the Russian military blamed Ukraine for the attack on the boarding school, also calling it a “war crime.” “The launch of enemy missiles from the [Ukrainian] Sumy region was detected by Russian air defense systems,” the Russian military said in a statement Sunday. The statement went on to accuse Ukraine of using the “provocation” to distract global “public opinion from [Ukraine’s] atrocities” in a separate area of the Kursk region. CNN cannot independently verify the claims by Ukraine and Russia. The spat occurred as Ukraine’s air defenses shot down dozens of drones overnight as Russia carried out fresh attacks, the country’s air force said Sunday. In total, the air force said it downed 40 out of the 55 drones launched in areas across the country, including the capital Kyiv, but added that Kharkiv and Sumy regions were impacted by the “enemy attack.” Ukrainianenergy infrastructurewas also targeted in multiple regions on the night of February 1, Ukraine’s air force added.\n",
            "Deadly floodwaters triggered by record rainfall inAustralia’snortheast rose for a third day Monday as authorities warned flood-stricken communities to brace themselves for further destruction. One person drowned in the flooding on Sunday and thousands of residents in low-lying coastal suburbs and towns are under immediate evacuation orders after nearly a summer’s worth of rain fell on large parts of North Queensland in just a few days. Impacted areas are dotted along the 735-kilometer (456 mile) stretch of the Queensland coast from Cairns – a gateway to the Great Barrier Reef - to Mackay, with the city of Townsville, Ingham town, and Cardwell among the worst hit by flash floods and overflowing rivers. “To see the level of devastation in that community is very difficult,” Queensland Premier David Crisafulli said of Ingham on Monday, adding that homes, businesses and the agricultural sector have been badly damaged. “That is a very strong and resilient community, but this is a flood the likes of which is only seen a handful of times,” he said. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology extended a severe weather warning on Monday for large parts of the coast, saying “severe thunderstorms with heavy to intense rainfall are possible today.” Some areas have seen up to a meter of rainfall in the past week, and major flood warnings have been issued for areas along six rivers that are running well above flood levels. A woman in her 60s died in Ingham after a rescue boat she was traveling in capsized after hitting a tree on Sunday morning, according toCNN affiliate Nine News. State Disaster Coordinator Shane Chelepy said the woman was one of six people on the boat, with the five others rescued. In an update on Monday, Chelepy said there have been no further fatalities, and no people reported missing since Sunday. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the death “heartbreaking news,” in a post on X. “My thoughts are with the family and the entire community at this awful time,” he said, adding that the federal government “will supply whatever resources are required to deal with this event.” Meanwhile, Queensland’s Department of Environment, Science and Innovation has warned residents to be wary of crocodiles that could be lurking in the floodwaters, according toNine News. “During flooding crocodiles can turn up in places they haven’t been seen before as they move about in search of calmer waters,” the department said in a statement. “Expect crocodiles in all north and far north Queensland waterways even if there is no warning sign.” State Disaster Coordinator Chelepy said Monday that officials had received 480 calls for assistance overnight – the most reported in recent days – as well as multiple emergency alerts and reports of flash flooding. Response teams made 11 swift water rescues of people stranded in their homes or trapped in vehicles from the rising waters, Chelepy said. In hard-hit Townsville, six low-lying suburbs have been designated as a “black zone” and residents there have evacuated. More than 400 people have taken refuge in six evacuation centers set up to house those who had to flee their homes, authorities said. The city of about 200,000 people was hit bydevastating floodingin 2019which was labeledby the then state premier as a “one-in-100-year event.” Crisafulli said Sunday that this weekend’s rains could match those conditions. “Take precautions, prepare for the worst, listen to the advice. This is a serious event,” he said. This is the third time in the past six years that Townsville has been hit by record-breaking floodwater. In December, the city was hit with its heaviest rains in 15 years, Queensland’s government said in a statement. Its airport recorded more than 250mm of rainfall between 19-24 December, with the coastal town of Toolakea in Townsville’s suburbs recording 346mm of rain in the same period. An emergency alert was issued Sunday for the small coastal community of Bluewater, north of Townsville, with local disaster-response officials telling residents “your life may be at risk.” “Water is rising fast and there will be dangerous and life-threatening flooding,” Townsville Local Disaster Management Group said. “If you do not leave it may become too dangerous for emergency services to rescue you.” Relief and rescue efforts have been hampered after a bridge collapsed along the Bruce Highway, a major road that runs from the south to the far north of the state. “The north and all of regional Queensland are at the mercy of one road,” Premier Crisafulli said. “There is an opportunity through disaster to build back better.” The flooding comes after days of torrential rain and damaging winds brought on by two low pressure tropical systems, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Intense rain events are also getting heavier and more frequent as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution and the consequences of the climate crisis worsens extreme weather. Relief is in sight as the rainfall is expected to ease in the coming days but residents in several areas have been warned to expect more life-threatening rain and major floods on Monday. “This is a significant and protracted weather event that we’re seeing with record breaking rainfall in many locations,” Matthew Collopy, senior meteorologist at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, said Monday. “There is already an incredible amount of water on the ground, there is more significant rain to come. So it will take days for that water to come out of those systems.” Months’ worth of rain has fallen over the past few days, with the rural town of Rollingstone recording 1,280 millimeters (50.3 inches) over the past week. Rainfall totals of 600 mm (about 23 inches) have also been recorded in places between Innisfail and Townville, according to the bureau. “More than six months worth of rain was recorded in the past three days in and around Townsville,” the bureau said in a post on X. Ingham Airport, which closed on Sunday, has seen over 830 mm (32 inches) of rainfall since Friday and nearly 1,000 mm (40 inches) of rainfall in the past week. A nearby weather station shows the area has had nearly a summer’s worth of rain in that time, with the bulk of it falling in the past few days. The hard-hit town of Cardwell has been drenched with more rain in the past 24 hours than its entire February average, with 490 mm (19.3 inches) falling in the past day. And Paluma Dam saw 712 mm (28.03 inches) of rainfall Friday to Saturday morning and another 500 mm (20 inches) of rainfall Sunday to Monday morning, which is well over a meter of rainfall since Friday. The intense rains have swelled rivers beyond their flood levels and authorities have begun releasing water through spillways on the Ross River Dam to relieve pressure. Though river levels in some areas have begun falling, the bureau said. This story has been updated with additional information.\n",
            "Driving throughTashkentfeels like flipping through an architecture picture book teeming with examples of Soviet brutalist, orientalist, modernist, futurist and neoclassical styles. One marvel after another, buildings in Uzbekistan’s capital city whiz by like a carousel for design lovers. After an earthquake leveled much of its infrastructure in 1966, Tashkent became a laboratory of urbanism. Architects arrived en masse to rebuild roads, apartment blocks, hotels, theaters, shopping malls, metro stations and a panoply of public structures that offered different takes on progressive socialist living. Today, new landmarks designed by the firms of “starchitects” such as the lateZaha HadidandTadao Andoare in the works, as well as an “Olympic City” comprisingfive state-of-the-art sportsvenues  for the 2025 Asian Youth Olympic Games. Beyond the capital, the cities of Bukhara, Samarkand and Khiva contain an array of ancient “toki” (domed markets), “madrasa” (schools) and “caravanserai” (inns) built for traders who traversed the Silk Road. Now, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s government is pouring resources into highlighting this rich architectural legacy as part of a campaign to open the former USSR republic to the world. Conservation work on its historic sites is a top priority. “By preserving and restoring these unique architectural treasures, we position Uzbekistan as a global cultural destination,” said Gayane Umerova, chairperson of the Uzbekistan Art & Culture Development Foundation (ACDF) in a statement to CNN. The investment, she added, will be paid off “through increased tourism revenue, job creation, urban revitalization, and cultural branding, as well as preserving and reimagining our heritage in this new era.” Reimagining a collective identity is something of a preoccupation for a nation that only gained its independence from the USSR in 1991. Within Uzbekistan, where 60% of the population is under 30 years old, not everyone is particularly enamored with vestiges of its Soviet past. Young Uzbeks often opt to live in Western-style apartments and point to the gleaming towers in the international business district, including the sprawlingTashkent City Mall, as points of pride. Inevitably, generic glass-and-steel modernity sometimes buts against preservationists’ agendas. The demolition of the iconicDom Kino cinema house—  to make way for a business park — in 2017, in particular, spurred heritage advocates to action. Over the past three years, ACDF has held 10 exhibitions in 10 countries, including shows atParis’ Louvre Museumand theMilan Triennale. It has also convened conferences (one of which was headlined by celebrated Dutch architecture theorist Rem Koolhaas and anotherfeatured expertsfrom UNESCO, the Guggenheim, Venice Heritage and the British Council), developed a “Tashkent Modernism”app, and commissioned a meticulously researched900-page booktitled “Tashkent Modernism XX/XXI.” Getting influential voices outside of Uzbekistan to rally behind unloved local treasures has, historically, proven to be effective, according to Ekaterina Golovatyuk, a Milan-based architect, researcher and co-editor of “Tashkent Modernism.” “Nobody really cared about Soviet modernism until that book byFrédéric Chaubin,” she said, referring to the hugely popular coffee-table book “CCCP: Cosmic Communist Constructions,”a 2011 architectural survey of 14 former Soviet republics published by Taschen. French photographer Chaubin’s travelogue, she said, spurred architectural expeditions like Canadian photographer Christopher Herwig’s catalog of Soviet bus stops and Garage Museum’s Soviet modernism guidebook series. “People … started saying, ‘If somebody is traveling from so far away and actually covering it in such a regional way, that must mean something. We might have been underestimating the relevance of this,’” Golovatyuk added. Social media influencers who introduce their followers to Uzbekistan’s under-the-radar wonders are helping, too. “It gives visibility to this architecture and transforms it into some sort of cultural and artistic product — something that you don’t perceive when you walk past it every day in the city,” Golovatyuk said. Amid the current construction boom, Uzbekistan is again serving as a magnet for progressive building ideas, just as it did in the 1960s and 1970s. This time, however, the most consequential issue is sustainability. Wael Al Awar, the Lebanese architect co-curating the Uzbekistan’sinaugrual Bukhara Biennial, says the country’s ancient cities are teeming with green solutions. Buildings are responsible for almost40% of global carbon emissions, and Al Awar points to the “standardization and globalization in architecture” as a culprit, adding that contemporary concrete buildings have also resulted in a homogenization of the world’s skylines. “Uzbekistan’s structures, in contrast, are contextual,” he said “They’re made by local communities who know the weather and the climate, and respond to that when they build. This is something we’ve lost.” Most ancient buildings in Uzbekistan are naturally energy-efficient, according to Takhmina Turdialieva, co-founder of the Tashkent-based collective,Tatalab, referring to the historic public buildings and dwellings found in Uzbekistan’s Silk Road cities. “It’s very pleasant in the summer and (buildings stay) warm during the winter because of the choice of construction materials and well-designed air circulation. If we learn those passive design methods, we don’t need any new technologies to make buildings more sustainable,” she said. “Modern architecture in Uzbekistan should be based on traditional construction materials like brick and clay,” she added. “We can express different designs with those eco-friendly materials and keep traditions in mind. I think this is how we express modern Uzbek,” she says. Thisnew vision of modernityis taking shape inNew Tashkent City, a 20,000-hectare extension of Uzbekistan’s capital that posits to become a locus of sustainable design ideas. Zaha Hadid Architects’ winning design for the Alisher Navoi International Scientific Research Centre, for instance, uses locally made bricks to achieve the firm’s signature avant-garde swooping structures Turdialieva, who also leads the Young Architect’s Association of Uzbekistan, adds that a global spotlight on Uzbek design could help invigorate the country’s next generation of architects. “Maybe this will be a starting point when more attention will be paid to local architects so they can better develop their potential,” she said.\n",
            "The past year has seen the opening of the world’ssecond-tallest skyscraper, the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral and the announcement of countless futuristic urban mega-projects. Yet, the architecture world has, increasingly, recognized the value of altogether humbler pursuits. In March, the industry’s most prestigious accolade, the Pritzker Prize, was unexpectedly awarded to Japanese housing pioneerRiken Yamamoto,while asmall schoolin suburban Australia was later named the best new building at the World Architecture Festival. So, while 2025 will, as ever, be one that celebrates grand infrastructure projects and feats of engineering, smaller-scale designs — and those with genuine environmental credentials — may also find themselves in the global spotlight. From innovative timber buildings to one of Asia’s largest new airports, here are 11 projects opening in the next 12 months. The world’s third largest fish market is getting even bigger. More than eight years after the New South Wales government announced the relocation of Sydney’s historic fish market — which dates to the 1870s but has been on its current site since 1966 — the gleaming new four-floor building is opening on an adjacent 3.6-hectare site. Designed by 3XN Architects and Australian firm BVN (whichpromisesvisitors a “multi-sensory fish market experience”), the reimagined facility balances tourist infrastructure with the functional realities of a working wholesale market. Logistics and operations are hidden away in the basement, while the upper floors contain a market hall for visitors and an auction hall where restaurateurs and retailers bid on fresh catches as they arrive via pontoons. The project will also help rejuvenate an industrial part of the harbor with shops, restaurants, a promenade and an urban park, while the distinctive undulating roof is topped with 350 triangular solar panels. From April to October, Japan’s second cityOsaka plans to welcome an estimated 28 million visitors to Expo 2025, which will see around 40 countries build custom pavilions on site. The centerpiece, however, is the venue itself: The Grand Ring, a continuous circular wooden structure, more than 1.2 miles in circumference, that will take visitors around the vast site. Expo venues can serve as an expression of their host’s design ethos. When Osaka first hosted the Expo, in 1970, it erected a huge space-frame roof by the mostcelebrated avant-garde Japanese architectsof the time. So, in an age where timber buildings offer an alternative to carbon-intensive concrete, it seems fitting that the Grand Ring’s creator Sou Fujimoto is presenting a distinctly Japanese take on the global trend. Using local cedar and cypress wood (as well as Scottish pine), the architect’s vision combines modern construction methods with the wooden joints traditionally used in Japanese temples and shrines. At almost 646,000 square feet, it will be among the world’s largest wooden buildings. Although intended to be temporary, there is ongoing debate about whether — or how — the structure might be preserved. The UK’s University of Oxford may be closely associated with grand gothic architecture, but it also operates in an ever-evolving portfolio of contemporary properties scattered through the city. The latest of them, a new 270,000-square-foot life sciences building, concludes the largest construction project ever undertaken in the institution’s centuries-long history. The design principles of the Life and Mind Building reflect an academic one: that uniting the departments of experimental psychology and biology under one roof will encourage greater collaboration and engagement between them. Inside, flexible lab spaces accommodate the needs of the different disciplines while a public plaza offers the chance of more casual interactions. Despite plenty of modern touches, the American architecture practice behind the project, NBBJ, nods to the university’s architectural heritage through stone facades and projected buttresses that produce what it calls a “a timeless but recognizable appearance.” Organicarchitecture is often celebrated for blending (or even disappearing completely) into the landscape, leaving as little trace on the surroundings as possible. There’s perhaps no better example among this year’s new openings than architecture firm Sordo Madaleno’s Canadian School in Cholula, Mexico. The serene campus looks to the region’s topography for inspiration — namely a nearby pre-Hispanic pyramid and the Popocatépetl volcano, which serves as a dramatic backdrop. The school is arranged around seven circular structures that take the form of overlapping hills, their terraced surfaces providing green spaces for students to explore. Mexican architect Fernando Sordo Madaleno, grandson of the firm’s late founder Juan Sordo Madaleno, said in a statement that as well as blending with the environment, “the building itself becomes part of the playground.” Cambodia is replacing its capital Phnom Penh’s international airport with one capable of handling six times as many visitors. Part of the country’s ambitious bid to boost tourism numbers and become a regional aviation hub, the new Techo International Airport’s initial capacity of 13 million annual passengers will eventually rise to 30 million. The terminal building, located 12 miles south of the city center, will be one of Southeast Asia’s largest. Plans to generate energy through an onsite solar farm also put it among the world’s greenest, according to architects Foster + Partners. With a form inspired by traditional Cambodian design, the terminal’s main roof is supported by a series of structural timber “trees” (real trees will also rise through a large central void). Digital renderings show the structure’s gridded steel shell filtering daylight and illuminating an interior bursting with tropical greenery, while passengers will reach their gates via two airfoil-shaped wings. A major expansion of Boston’s South Station, the busiest ground transport hub in New England, is wrapping up this year. Upon completion, the redevelopment project will have increased the terminal’s bus capacity by 50%, while its rail capacity will be unaffected. Architecturally speaking, the challenge facing American firm Pelli Clarke & Partners was not only to reimagine the hub’s concourse and erect a soaring 51-story skyscraper above it, but to respect the original Classical Revival station building. Listed under the US National Register of Historic Places, it has stood there since 1899. The resulting contrast — between gleaming glass and weathered stone — was always going to be stark. But the tower’s soft, sculptural form seeks to complement its historic counterpart. The expanded, arched concourse meanwhile offers visitors a more grandiose arrival into the city. The first ever African winner of the Pritzker Prize, an award dubbed the “Nobel of architecture,”Francis Kéréis using his global profile to transform the built environment in his home continent. The Burkinabè architect is a longstanding champion of “vernacular” design, which looks to traditional building materials and construction techniques. And his vision for the new Senegalese branch of Goethe-Institut, the German cultural exchange center, is a case in point. The 18,300-square-foot building’s gentle curves were designed to mirror the outline of the surrounding canopies. It was constructed primarily from locally sourced bricks, which are made from compacted earth and arranged in lattice formations to encourage natural ventilation. Speaking to CNN in 2022, Kéré explained the importance of local materials, saying: “The more… you use, the better you can promote the local economy and (build) local knowledge, which also makes people proud.” More than a decade after the CCTV Headquarters in Beijing opened to become, arguably, China’s best-known contemporary building, its co-designer Ole Scheeren continues to leave his footprint on the county. The German architect’s firm, Büro Ole Scheeren, currently has majorprojects underwayin various Chinese cities, fromShenzhento Nanjing. Among the most striking among is Urban Glen, a pair of dramatically stepped towers containing nearly 900,000 square feet of office, hotel and leisure space in the eastern city of Hangzhou. Like the hills surrounding Hangzhou on three sides, the two volumes — one of which houses a Rosewood Hotel — appear to cascade into a manmade valley of roof terraces, shops and public art. The 2020s have seen Saudi Arabia announce a slew of mega-scale — and often bombastic — architectural ventures, from a new cityarranged in a lineto a cube-shaped skyscraper that will become one of the world’s largest built structures. But plans to bequeath the capital city Riyadh with a much-needed metro system date back more than a decade. Comprising six lines, the vast network is set to transform how the city operates, with a daily capacity of 3.6 million passengers. Above ground, its metro stations are becoming visual spectacles, with Zaha Hadid Architects and German firm Gerber Architekten among the high-profile foreign firms invited to design some of the 85 stations. While the project was inaugurated in November, and many of the lines went into operation last month, the project won’t be completed until the new year. Perhaps the most notable station yet to open is celebrated Norwegian firm Snøhetta’s Qasr Al Hokm — its striking stainless-steel canopy providing shade and channeling natural light into the cavernous interior. Europe continues to push the boundaries of wooden construction, with France now requiring all new public buildings to include at least 50% timber. Neighboring Luxembourg, meanwhile, is soon set to welcome one of the continent’s largest hybrid wooden buildings to date: the Skypark Business Center. Set across more than 844,000 square feet of floor space, it was built using over 542,000 cubic feet of timber — enough to fill up six Olympic-size pools — while the copper facade is made from 80% recycled metal. With its softly rounded edges, the structure’s unique shape can be understood as two alternating, zig-zagging strips that snake across one another along the site. Their various intersections create a series of courtyards and roof spaces, with the building’s occupants never more than 50 meters (164 feet) from a green terrace, according to architects BIG. The building, the first phase of which completes February, largely comprises office space, in addition to shops and a hotel. But ground-level courtyards will be open to passersby — and plane enthusiasts, who can enjoy views of the adjacent Luxembourg Airport. For almost nine years, the late Zaha Hadid’s firm has continued her legacy, producing dozens of new designs channeling the ethos and identity of an architect dubbed “Queen of the Curve.” But the Danjiang Bridge, in Taiwan, was announced in 2015 — the year before Hadid’s death — meaning it will be among the last projects to be realized that she personally oversaw. The 3,018-foot-long structure will connect four major highways over the mouth of the Tamsui River, which flows through Taiwan’s capital, Taipei. It features a surprisingly slender profile, with the entire structure supported by just a single concrete mast (which the firm’s project description says “minimizes” the bridge’s “visual impact” on its surroundings). Nonetheless, it will become the world’s longest single-mast asymmetrical cable-stayed bridge when it opens later this year. It is a sign of the architect’s unique aesthetic that, even with just one mast to play with, its rounded edges and gently warped form is still, somehow, signature Hadid.\n",
            "A Palestinian toddler forced to wait weeks for permission to leave Gaza for life saving medical treatment has finally arrived in Jordan. The girl is now in hospital receiving critical medical treatment. Two-year-old Habiba al-Askari left the besieged Palestinian enclave after a mammoth effort at the “highest level” in Amman, a Jordanian official familiar with the negotiations told CNN. Jordan decided to evacuate her following a CNN report onher story. Israel initially approved Habiba’s treatment abroad last month, before it denied authorization for medical evacuations for more than two weeks, according to international aid groups. Doctors believe Habiba has protein C deficiency – a rare but highly treatable genetic condition, which causes excessive blood clotting – and warned that the child will likely lose her right leg and possibly arms. But thousands of children like Habiba cannot access life-saving care in Gaza, where more than 15 months of Israel’s siege and bombardment has paralyzed the medical system. Following aCNN reporton Habiba last month, Jordan decided to evacuate her to Amman for urgent medical treatment. Israel then delayed the mission, Jordanian officials told CNN last week. Israeli authorities did not respond to CNN’s repeated requests for comment at the time. On Thursday, Habiba was admitted into intensive care in Gaza’s Nasser Hospital with a lung infection. Her heart stopped twice, according to her mother and health workers who resuscitated her. On Sunday, Israel further delayed clearing the evacuation – postponing the urgent mission and refusing to allow her mother Rana to accompany her daughter. In CNN video from the hospital over the weekend, Rana, 37, sobbed and embraced her daughter at her bedside. In one scene, Habiba, who is too young to understand her mother’s pain, leaned over and kissed her mother on the cheeks. “Oh Lord I pray to you for a miracle, but if this is your will, I will accept it,” Rana cried before collapsing to the floor. Habiba, sitting up in her bed, stared quietly at the nurses who rushed to pick up her mother. Jordanian officials worked behind the scenes to obtain Israeli approval for Rana to escort Habiba and the girl’s brother Soheib. To spare Habiba a long and perilous journey, Jordan had requested an airlift by its military from the Israel-Gaza border, but Israel denied that request, according to a senior Jordanian official, who told CNN Israeli authorities would only approve a land movement. On Sunday, Israel then authorized Soheib’s journey – before revoking its permission at the last minute, according to Jordanian officials. The official told CNN that they finally obtained approval for the whole family to leave Gaza early Monday. The senior official described the mission to evacuate Habiba as unnecessarily difficult. “We worked relentlessly, daily, to get Habiba out. It was followed at the highest levels in Jordan,” the official said. COGAT, the Israeli aid agency, told CNN on Monday: “Israel has approved Habiba Mahmoud Abd al-Nasser Askari’s departure to Jordan for medical treatment, accompanied by her mother and her 10-year-old brother.” Approvals for the departure of children and their family members for medical treatment were “subject to a security review by relevant authorities before their entry into Israel’s sovereign territory,” COGAT said on January 14. Israel’s military campaign since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks has erased entire families, spawned starvation and disease, and decimated medical infrastructure in Gaza. After a fragile ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas materialized on January 19,Palestinians saythey are struggling to reconcile the psychological trauma and physical destruction wrought by more than a year of war. On Monday, the toddler and her family were first transferred in an ambulance by Gaza’s health ministry to the Kerem Shalom border crossing with Israel and handed over to a Jordanian medical team. Habiba was then taken through Israel and into Jordan via the King Hussein Bridge, also known as the Allenby Bridge crossing, where a medical team dispatched at the order of King Abdullah II was waiting in a helicopter to take her to a hospital in Amman. A CNN team on the ground at the Jordanian side of the border heard sirens and saw blue and red ambulance lights illuminating a path leading to the helicopter. Three military medics met Rana and her two children inside the emergency vehicle Monday evening before the family were transferred into the chopper. The toddler lay swaddled in a blanket with a red fluffy toy as Rana gazed out the window, her eyes weary with exhaustion after her first time leaving Gaza. ﻿Military medics monitored Habiba’s oxygen levels throughout the ten-minute flight to Amman before they arrived at the Queen Rania Al Abdullah Hospital for Children. Habiba was then seen to by medical workers at the facility. Habiba lay in bed and beamed up at her older brother. COGAT previously told CNN that it has enabled 24 medical evacuations from Gaza through Israel to other countries “in recent months,” for 1,075 Gaza residents seeking medical care.Between 12,000 to 14,000 people still require medical evacuation from Gaza, according to the World Health Organization. At least 37 patients and 39 companions left Gaza from Rafah, WHO saidon Saturday, after the crossing re-opened. Like Habiba, 2,500 other children in Gaza require urgent medical evacuation, according to the UN. But for those waiting for a lifeline, there is no such promise, according to a humanitarian worker in the region. Arwa Damon, the founder of the relief organization INARA, told CNN that Israel’s process for facilitating children’s medical evacuations from Gaza is “never clear.” INARA was not involved in Habiba’s evacuation mission. “It’s like trying to navigate a twisted reality TV show… where the rules for survival are… constantly shifting and the stakes are a child’s life,” Damon said Monday. “What we have faced trying to get Habiba out is not unique to her, it’s the status quo.”\n",
            "Millions dined in their restaurants worldwide, getting a taste of Malaysia supplied by a sprawling conglomerate that claimed to embrace Islamic values by caring for thousands of disadvantaged children they said were orphans in homes across the country. But the leaders of Global Ikhwan Services and Business Holdings (GISBH) are now fighting allegations they ran a cult-like organization that forced followers to work and have many children, some allegedly conceived through rape, to populate orphanages and raise donations that funded their lavish lifestyles. When Malaysian police raided two dozen homes run by the company in mid-September, they rescued over 600 children and have since detained hundreds of people, charging some with crimes including child trafficking, sexual abuse and organized crime. GISBH lawyer Rosli Kamaruddin says the group’s leaders plan to fight the charges. In a monthslong investigation CNN spoke to more than a dozen people including former members, their lawyers, and religious scholars to understand how for decades Global Ikhwan, and the alleged abuse they perpetrated, remained Malaysia’s best-kept secret. Former followers told CNN they had no contact with the outside world or access to cellphones and received their only news via an in-house television channel that promoted the teachings of Al Arqam, an Islamic cult that was banned by the Malaysian government in the mid-90s for “deviant” beliefs that strayed far from orthodox teachings. This is the story of the cult’s apparent revival – complete with its own prison islands and “holy water” infused with the leaders’ hair and bathwater that former members say was sprayed on goods produced in their factories and on meals served to diners at their restaurants. CNN has reached out to GISBH for comment on the allegations within this story but is yet to receive a response. Royal Malaysia Police launched a series of raids in September on dozens of care homes operated by GISBH, and over several weeks rescued hundreds of children they say were the offspring of company employees. In one press briefing, Police Inspector General Razarudin Husain told reporters children were groomed, malnourished and subject to “child labor, exploitation.” Health screenings conducted on 392 children found all had suffered physical or emotional abuse. “They themselves were abused by their caretakers. Thenthey were forced to sodomize otherchildren,” Husain told another press briefing. As the raids unraveled, GISBH restaurants, grocery stores and laundromats were closed, blinds drawn, logos stripped off the walls and social media accounts shut down. Some of the groups’ members fled back to their hometowns across Malaysia and were awaiting instructions from the group’s leaders as to what to do next, their families said. In raids on houses affiliated with GISBH leadership, police found dozens of books and photographs associated with Ashaari Muhammad, the founder of Al Arqam. Some had been buried in a riverbed, their pages caked in mud. Al Arqam was an Islamic group – led by Ashaari, known as “Abuya” or Father to his followers – that believed in building a self-sufficient Islamic community with Malaysia at the center of the Muslim world. It was banned by the Malaysian government in 1994 for “deviant” teachings, a decision that at the time was questioned by international rights groups as a potential breach of religious freedom. Ashaari subsequently spent 10 years under house arrest and died in 2010. GISBH’s promotional material says the company was founded by Ashaari “with the aim to develop the Islamic way of life in all aspects of life such as education, arts and culture, animal farming.”  Before the raids, GISBH had about 100 care homes housing many of the 3,000 “youths” the group claimed to be their “employees,” according to former members and information from the company’s website. One of Ashaari’s daughters, Ummu Atiyah, told CNN the movement had changed since her father’s leadership. “Women are treated with all kinds of abuse … and all the money only goes to the leaders’ comfort” she said. “They have jet skis, motorhomes, vehicles that were not there when my father led the movement.” Those arrested include GISBH CEO Nasiruddin Mohd Ali who admitted in a video statement that “one or two cases of sodomy” occurred, but he rejected all other allegations made against the group as slander. “I am not trying to blame the law. Indeed, we have done some wrong in the eyes of the law […] Indeed, there were one or two cases of sodomy, but why lump them all together?” he said. Nasiruddin, alongside other GISBH leadership, has since been charged with belonging to an organized crime group and is currently awaiting trial. Among those also charged is Mohammad Adib At-Tarmimi, the son of Ashaari. The highly publicized case shocked the nation. While most Malaysians had heard about Abuya and Al Arqam back in the 90s, few knew about their connection to GISBH and the alleged abuses that went on inside the company. But it came as no surprise to anyone who had ever worked for GISBH. Farid, who recently left GISBH, was 27 when he joined the group in 2010 after years of struggling with drug addiction. “I give my soul, I give myself to them because they want to fix me,” said Farid, who asked to use a pseudonym to protect his family. He was in an arranged marriage with the daughter of a senior member and quickly had two daughters. When their older daughter turned two, she was sent to live in a charity home, like most GISBH children. At first glance, some of the welfare homes bear no association to GISBH. Some carried the GISBH logo, but others appeared to be normal houses with yards strewn with toys on quiet suburban streets. Facebook pages run by the homes show small children said to be orphans in religious garb, singing and praying, imploring followers to donate or givezakatto buy food, clothes or school supplies. Zakat is a form of religious alms-giving and one of the five mandatory pillars of Islam. But the children were not orphans. In most cases their parents were GISBH workers, like Farid, though some hadn’t seen their kids in years. Instead, they were raised by caretakers who in some cases were only a few years older than them, according to former members and law enforcement. The days were spent studying Islam and praying, not just to Allah but to Nasiruddin, the chief executive of GISBH and other leaders of the company, Farid, who briefly worked at a boys’ care home in the 2010s, told CNN. The kids were told, “Your mother is nothing, your father is nothing, there is only your leader – Nasiruddin,” he said. “At night the children sleep with tears [in their eyes].” Over time many of the children came to believe they actually were orphans, he added, while authorities said some couldn’t identify their parents. Farid says his daughter quickly changed after moving into a welfare home. “My daughter was a cheerful girl, always smiling, always laughing but when she went there, she was very sad, she had no self-confidence,” he said. When he visited his daughter, he said she looked malnourished, her hands covered in scabies – an infection caused by mites that burrow their way under the skin and lay eggs there. The condition was seen in many children who were rescued from the care homes, according to images shared with CNN. Amir, another former GISBH worker, told CNN that before he left the group in 2021, he tried to visit his four-year-old son at the care home as often as possible. Amir, who asked to use a pseudonym to protect his family, said caretakers told him the boy was often crying and wetting his pants. One time he visited, his son had stitches on his chin and forehead. Amir said a caretaker had admitted throwing the boy in anger after he wet himself. The boy also told his father he was locked in a dog kennel as punishment. “They asked me to keep the matter a secret,” Amir said, but he said almost everyone at the group knew about other instances of abuse that went on in the care homes. If their child hadn’t been hurt, they knew somebody whose kid had been, he said. The group’s headquarters was a sprawling compound complete with horse stables in the town of Rawang, a 30-minute drive from the capital Kuala Lumpur. One local resident recalled that the arrival of the Al Arqam-linked community in the early 2000s drew attention from locals, but there was an “unspoken boundary” between the group and the rest of the town’s residents. Life inside the community was tightly controlled. Former followers told CNN they had no contact with the outside world or access to cellphones. An in-house production company made news-like programming about their leaders that was broadcast on their own television channel called Ikhwan TV. Programming included prayers, cartoons and live coverage from motorsport and equestrian events organized by the group, according to former members. “GISBH embodies the criteria of a cult – absolute loyalty to leaders, charismatic leader at the core of the movement; exclusive membership and severe penalty for leaving, members’ loss of personal autonomy,” said Dr Azmil Tayeb, a political scientist and associate professor at Universiti Sains Malaysia, who specializes in Islamic political and social movements. Men and women, even married couples, lived in gender-segregated dorms and were not allowed to meet without the leaders’ approval, former members said. Even if you saw your wife in the courtyard you couldn’t speak to her, Farid recalled. Instead, married couples had to apply for what were essentially conjugal visits, scheduled appointments where couples were expected to have sex, several former members said. Viagra was provided and in some cases group leaders demanded to know the details the next morning, said Farid. “I saw myself as a sex slave, I didn’t see myself as a wife,” said Zoey, a former member from Singapore, who left the group in 2021 and asked to use a pseudonym to protect her young children. “The role as a woman in GISB is only for you to give birth.” Zoey’s family joined GISBH when she was a teenager, and she struggled to adapt to the restrictive culture of the group. At the age of 17, she was deemed “uncontrollable” by the leadership and married to a man 10 years her senior. Within weeks of being married, her husband became physically and sexually abusive towards her, she said. He regularly raped her, she said. Zoey said she tried to go on birth control pills but when her husband found out, she was beaten again and forced to stop. Her complaints to the group elders went unheard, she said. Instead, she was told to obey her husband as “he is your heaven.” Zoey fled the marriage and now cares for their nine children in Singapore – the eldest nearly the age she was when she was forced to marry. Other female members CNN spoke to echoed Zoey’s experience of abuse and sexual violence. Many of them said they were forcibly married as teenagers, others gifted to men as rewards for business successes. In 2022, the group claimed to have more than 5,000 employees working in restaurants, bakeries, factories and supermarkets and other businesses in 20 countries including Australia, the UK, France, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, where they also ran a resort, according to their website and news reports. Farid and Amir both recall working from dusk until dawn in Ikhwan factories producing noodles, chili sauce, and other condiments 365 days a year. Like most GISBH employees, they said they were never paid for their work but were provided food and board. Sometimes their colleagues were children, they said. Photos shared with CNN show prepubescent children packaging noodles and operating factory machinery. The minimum age for full-time work inMalaysia is 15. The company’s unsettling practices allegedly extended to the food factories where workers sprayed so-called holy water on products sold to the public, according to several former members. “Holy water” or “Air Berkat” was a concoction made by mixing the leaders’ saliva, body hair and bathwater. Members of the group believed that each part of their leaders’ bodies contained “berkat” or spiritual-magical properties. “I made chili paste, chili sauce and noodles, so I sprayed it [holy water] over them,” one former member told CNN. These products were then sold to the public in GISBH-owned supermarkets and used in their restaurants across the country, the former members said. The group’s overseas assets were among some of their most prized, despite them never turning profits, according to financial records analyzed by CNN. One former member told CNN that the overseas assets were a way for the group to gain “popularity” and build influence. Most former members CNN spoke to had at some point lived and worked abroad, living in company dorms, some while they were only teenagers. These locations also served as informal meeting places for the company to build relationships with government officials, Tayeb, the political scientist, explained. “They’ve always been well connected; we are not talking about an isolated cult in the middle of the jungle,” said Tayeb. GISBH’s connections reached the highest level of Malaysia’s elites. In April 2023, the executive chairman of the group and several other senior leaders met with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim at his private office. At the meeting, the prime minister “promised to help all efforts of GISBH in the name of the Muslim economy,” according to an article posted on Ikhwan News, the group’s own media publication. Following the raids in September, Anwar urged police and religious authorities to investigate and take appropriate action to address misconduct at the company. While some employees worked 16-hour shifts in factories, restaurants and resorts, GISBH leadership spent their time jetting around the world, meeting the highest rungs of Malaysian leadership and attending sporting events, with Nasiruddin taking a special interest in horseback riding and motorsports. Followers were told not to question the leaders’ lavish spending for it was all done in the name of Islam, one former member said. “They say we buy superbikes for Islam,” said the former member, who wished to remain anonymous. Anyone who asked questions or dissented was sent to “quarantine,” faraway camps where members spent months living in jungle huts with no water or electricity, repenting their sins, said several former members, recalling their experience. As one former member put it: “You ask today, tomorrow they send you to the quarantine island.” Nearly every single former GISBH member CNN spoke to had at one point been sent to quarantine. Zoey said she spent nearly half a year in quarantine while pregnant with her second child, where she was forbidden from speaking to anyone and denied medical checkups. Amir said he spent 10 months in quarantine on Tioman Island, a nature reserve popular with tourists off the main coast of Malaysia. He said he was sent there as punishment for trying to escape after learning about his son’s abuse. Since the raids in September, most of the children have returned to the care of their parents, but over 100 children are yet to be claimed by their families, authorities said. A lawyer representing several former members told CNN that in some cases children refuse to go home with parents who left the group because they’d been taught to fear them. “My children don’t love or respect me anymore. They have been brainwashed,” the lawyer recalled one of his clients telling him. The years of indoctrination will take some time to undo. After attending reeducation programs, the GISBH children will eventually be introduced to mainstream schools, according to Malaysia’s education ministry. There, they will for the first time become a part of Malaysian society. For the adults not facing charges, the future is unclear. Those who grew up inside the group have few life skills to fall back on, and many of the men have multiple wives and many children they now need to support. Former members told CNN a sense of security came with living within GISBH. Their lives were at times lonely and limited, but one day they hoped to reap the rewards of their devotion. “They say if you are in the group, you are on the highway to Heaven,” Farid said. Outside, Zoey said, former members “have nowhere to go.” On January 9 GISBH posted a message on their Facebook page after months of silence. “Some people are created to be a test to other people,” it read. “So be patient with all this.”\n",
            "The family home where rock bandAC/DCwas founded has been mistakenly demolished by a property developer inAustralia. Located in the Sydney suburb of Burwood, 4 Burleigh Street had long been a place visited by the band’s fans from around the world. AC/DC’s Malcolm and Angus Young lived in the house as teenagers when they were founding the band, along with their brother George Young, a guitarist for another wildly popular rock group, the Easybeats. The family migrated to Australia from Scotland, living first in a migrant hostel before moving to Burleigh Street in 1965. When the Easybeats made it big, a mini riot once reportedly unfolded outside the house when a fan magazine disclosed the address. Hundreds of girls from local high schools descended upon the house and twenty forced their way inside – trampling a young Angus on their way, according to the home’s listing on Australia’s National Trust Register. The one-story, two-bedroom brick house was bought by a property developer in March 2023 for 5.8 million Australian dollars ($3.6 million). It demolished the building last month, according to CNN affiliateNine News. The developer, Burwood Square, told Nine News that it didn’t know about the cultural importance of the home, despite conducting due diligence on the site. “Unfortunately the historical connection to AC/DC was not identified, and we regret the previous long-term owner did not share this vital part of the property’s background with us,” said Leon Kamita, the company’s general manager. “Learning about this connection after our plans were already underway has shocked us,” he said in a statement. The developers plan to turn the lot into a 144 meter (472 foot)50-story tower with 120 hotel rooms and 48 affordable housing apartments, according to Nine News. The suburban home, a bungalow built in the “Federation style” that was mass produced in the early 20thcentury, had been in “poor condition” since the Young family left it in 1978, according to a review published by the Burwood Council. In 1985, it became a brothel – with local newspapers promoting “Adult Work Opportunities” at the address, according to the council. It later served as a medical practice and was being rented out to an unspecified tenant at the time of the developer’s purchase. An article published in the Sydney Morning Herald back in 2003 argued for the building to be protected from the hands of developers. “There is however, one domicile begging for immediate acquisition and deification; a small, simple dwelling at 4 Burleigh Street,” wrote rock historian Glenn A. Baker. Although the house was listed on the Australian National Trust Register in 2013, it did not receive historical protection to prevent its demolition. Burwood Council conducted a review in 2015 to determine whether it should be listed as a heritage site. Ultimately, it did not recommend a heritage listing, citing among its reasons that the band’s “period of habitation was too brief to be relevant to the life and work of AC/DC.” The review also said the home “does not meet the criteria for aesthetic significance,” nor did it have “any known technical or research value.” In a statement sent to CNN, the council said “it has long-maintained that the Young House … has a special association with Australia’s rock music history as the site where band AC/DC formed.” Despite not recommending the heritage listing, the council said it continues to undertake initiatives to celebrate the band’s legacy, including the commissioning of a mural near the site. In its statement to Nine News, Burwood Square said it is “dedicated” to celebrating the location and is salvaging materials from the demolition to create a special space where fans can gather to celebrate the band’s legacy. CNN has reached out to representatives of AC/DC for comment.\n",
            "Khamis and Ahmad Imarah knew they wouldn’t find much more than rubble when returning to their home innorthern Gaza. But they had to go. Their father and brother are still buried under the debris, more than a year after their home was struck by Israeli forces. Standing in the middle of the Al-Shujaiya neighborhood in Gaza City on Tuesday, all Khamis Imarah could see wasutter devastation. “When I came back here my heart was ripped apart. The only thing that brought me back was my father and brother,” he told CNN. “I don’t want anything else. What I am asking for is to find my father and brother and that’s it, that’s all.” The Gaza Government Office said Wednesday that some 500,000 displaced Palestinians — almost a quarter of the enclave’s population — had made the journey to the decimated north in the first 72 hours after Israeli forces opened theNetzarim corridor, which separates it from the south. The two Imarah brothers walked 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) to reach Al-Shujaiya, a treacherous journey they made with several small children. They found their home almost completely gone, with just one room still partially standing. Rummaging through the rubble, Khamis came across his mother’s green knitting bag, with a couple of balls of yarn and two crochet hooks still inside, as if she had only just put it down. “She used to like to knit, she used to like wool and things like this,” he said, going through the supplies. “Oh God, my mom had so many stories. She is a storyteller, and she likes the old stories. She was an entertainer. God be with you, Mother,” he told CNN. Khamis and Ahmad’s mother was injured in an Israeli strike and was later evacuated to Egypt, one of the few Palestinians allowed to leave the strip to get medical treatment before Israel closed the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt in May 2024. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that only 436 patients, most of them children, had beenallowed to be evacuatedsince May, out of the estimated 12,000 who urgently need medical evacuation. Israeli military strikes have turned most of Gaza to rubble. According to the UN, some 69% of all structures in the strip have been destroyed or damaged in the past 15 months, with Gaza City the worst hit. Israel forced most residents of northern Gaza to leave the area early in the war, issuing evacuation orders and telling people to move south. Once people left, return was impossible, meaning that most of those coming back this week are doing so for the first time in more than a year. And while nine in 10 Gaza residents have been displaced during the war, those forced to flee the north have been homeless for the longest. The journey back north is long and difficult, Khamis told CNN, with roads destroyed and mud and piles of rubble obstructing the way. Transport is not widely available, so about a third of the people were making their way back on foot, according to OCHA. “You enter from one neighborhood to another and it’s all mounds of rubble that have not been cleared … and there were martyrs on the way, on the road where, until today, no one has picked them up. There are fresh bodies and bodies that have (decomposed) as well,” Khamis said. He urged others looking to make the journey back north to reconsider. “Because there is no water, no electricity or even food, no tents, you sleep in the rubble,” he said. Mohammad Salha, director of Al-Awda Hospital in Tal Al-Zaatar, said there is currently no space in northern Gaza to establish camps for displaced people returning home. The area was densely built-up before the war and the enormous scale of damage means there are now huge mountains of rubble and debris everywhere. “There are no camps for displaced residents to stay in. Some people are trying to repair their damaged homes, but northern Gaza urgently needs intervention — humanitarian institutions must provide shelter, water and camps,” he told CNN. The situation in the north is so dire that some of those who have made the journey have had little choice but to turn back and return to the refugee camps down south. Arwa Al-Masri, who was displaced from Beit Hanoun in the northeastern corner of the strip, said the men from her family went home in the past few days to see what is left of their houses. “They were shocked to find the amount of destruction and the lifelessness. There is nothing. No water — my brother had to go from Beit Hanoun to Jabalya to get water and then he had to go to Gaza (City) to call us to tell us not to come back yet. Most of the people who went back north have said there is no life and massive destruction only,” she told CNN at a shelter inside a school run by the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) south of the Netzarim corridor. But while she and her children cannot yet go back to her home in the north — or what remains of it — Al-Masri’s stay at the shelter is also uncertain, because of impending bans on UNRWA operations within Israel and on the prohibition of Israeli authorities from cooperating with UNRWA. “When UNRWA stops operating, people are not going to find food and many people who are in UNRWA shelter schools will not be able to stay. There will be no tents and shelter available,” she told CNN. Discovering that the place they once called home was almost completely gone was just the latest in a series of heartbreaks Khamis and Ahmad Imarah have suffered over the past 15 months. The two brothers said that of the 60 members of their extended family, only 11 have survived the war. “My daughter spent 45 days in the intensive care unit, my younger son is until today traumatized by seeing his mother being killed,” Ahmad told CNN, adding that his daughter’s right arm remains paralyzed after she was struck by shrapnel in her neck and foot. The family fled Al-Shujaiya after receiving text messages from the Israeli military telling them to leave the area. Khamis said the whole family — his brother and sisters and their in-laws — went to his brother’s house in Al-Mughraqa, just south of the Netzarim corridor. “It was afternoon prayers time when our house in Al-Mughraqa was hit by a strike. I still don’t know how I got out of the house,” he said. At one point during the interview, Ahmad’s son Walid came by. Asked by his father where his mom was, the child pointed up to the sky. “Why did they tell us to go south? Imagine a four-year-old boy telling you here is my mother and here is my aunt, (their bodies) all ripped in pieces in front of him. I covered his face and he was screaming. His aunts, and uncles, his grandfather and an uncle, no one is left,” he said. Khamis told CNN his wife died in the Israeli strike, just a week after giving birth to a baby girl who was also killed. “We were very happy. I wish I had a picture of my newborn but I don’t have any. I waited a long time to have my daughter and then her and her mom vanished together,” he said, adding that their graves were destroyed by the Israeli military just days after the family buried them. “You take them and bury them in the cemetery and then when you go a few days later to see the cemetery, you don’t find them because they have been erased by the bulldozers. The (Israeli forces) didn’t leave anything. Even the martyrs and the bodies they have dug up. They didn’t leave a thing,” he said, looking around the destroyed neighborhood. “We came back to the north for nothing,” he said. But he quickly added that he was determined to stay and rebuild. “I am from Gaza and I won’t leave. Even if it was harder and more difficult than this, I want to live in Gaza and I won’t leave it. I will only leave Gaza to go to Heaven,” he said. US President Donald Trump last week suggestedGaza should be “cleaned out”by removing Palestinians living there to Jordan and Egypt — either on a temporary or permanent basis. The comment sparked outrage and rebuke across the Middle East, with both Egypt and Jordan rejecting the idea. Khamis told CNN the importance of staying goes well beyond his own personal desires. “This is ingrained in our minds, we will stay. We will not leave this place, because this land is not ours but our grandparents’ and our ancestors’ before us. How am I supposed to leave it? To leave the house of my father, and grandfather and brothers?” he said.\n",
            "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa responded on Monday to US President Donald Trump’s threat to cut off aid over the alleged mistreatment of White farmers, denying Trump’s claim that authorities were “confiscating land.” “South Africa is a constitutional democracy that is deeply rooted in the rule of law, justice and equality. The South African government has not confiscated any land,” Ramaphosa wrote on X. “We look forward to engaging with the Trump administration over our land reform policy and issues of bilateral interest,” he wrote. He added that, while the US was a key strategic political and trade partner, it did not provide significant funding to South Africa besides a major HIV/AIDS relief program. His statement comes after Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday that he would cut off all future funding to the country until there was a full investigation into allegations that “South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY.” Trump’s long-held complaint, which he’d also made in 2018 during his first term, goes back to the complex land reform in South Africa. Racist policies of the past forcefully removed Black and non-White South Africans from the land for White use. There has been a land redistribution and restitution provision in the country’s constitution since South Africa emerged from its apartheid era and held its first democratic elections in 1994. However, unemployment and poverty remain acute among Black South Africans, who make up around 80% of the population, yet own a fraction of the land. In January, Ramaphosa signed a bill into law that sets forth new guidelines for land expropriation, including enabling the government to expropriate land without compensation in some cases. In his X post Monday, Ramaphosa said the law was “not a confiscation instrument,” but a legal process that “ensures public access to land in an equitable and just manner as guided by the constitution.” However, constitutional protections against expropriation without compensation still remain in place, and experts believe South Africa’s ruling party will face legal challenges if it seeks to implement the policy.\n",
            "President Donald Trump has finally made good on a campaign promise to raise tariffs on Chinese imports – announcing on Saturday duties of 10% on all Chinese goods coming in the country as part ofsweeping trade measuresthat also targeted Mexico and Canada. Now the question for Chinese leaders is how strongly to retaliate. In the wake of the announcement, Chinese officials – who were hit by Trump’s move while in the middle of a week-long public holiday – vowed to file a complaint with the World Trade Organization and “take corresponding countermeasures” without specifying in what form. The imposition of a 10% tariff on Chinese goods imported into the United States “seriously violates the WTO rules,” China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement Sunday, adding that China will “resolutely defend its rights.” That response, at least so far, has been noticeably less concrete than the ones from Mexico and Canada, which were both quick to pledge swift retaliatory tariffs. The latest announcement raises a 10% tariff on Chinese products, rather than the 25% on all goods from Mexico and most from Canada – all are expected to go into effect Tuesday. Unlike for China, where the latest tariffs top existing ones on a swath of goods, Canada and Mexico previously enjoyed nearly a duty-free relationship with the US. But there are other reasons besides the number next to the percentage sign and China’s public holiday that could account for the comparatively mild response from the world’s second largest economy. Beijing has enjoyed anunexpectedly warm start to Trump’s second term– a welcome development for Chinese leaders as they seek to avoid escalating trade and tech frictions at the same time as the export-reliant country’s economy slows. Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Trump had what the US leader called a “very good” phone call days before Trump took office, and his inaugural ceremony was attended by the highest-level Chinese official to ever be dispatched to such an event. The US president has also sent other signals he’s in dealmaking mode with Beijing – saying repeatedly he hopes to work with Xi on resolving Russia’s war in Ukraine and suggesting in a recent interview with Fox News that he thought Washington and Beijiing could reach a trade deal. While the president campaigned on winning economic competition with China and stacked his administration with a bevy of China hawks, the recent tone may suggest to Beijing that it’s better not to escalate too extensively, at least not yet. The 10% tariffs are a far cry from the upwards of 60% tariffs that Trump suggested he could levy on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail. Trump has – at least in his rhetoric – largely linked these duties to the role of Chinese suppliers in the fentanyl trade, not the gaping trade imbalance between the US and China. Instead, the expectation within China has been that Trump may be biding his time until he receives the results of a larger probe into US-China economic and trade relations that he commissioned in an executive order signed on his first day in office. “Trump may rely on the upcoming results of trade investigations to impose or expand tariffs on specific countries, testing their tolerance and willingness to negotiate,” an analysis published Sunday on the website of Shanghai-based think tank Fudan Development Institute said. “The risk of escalating into a ‘full-blown trade war’ cannot be ruled out. Before any actual actions are taken, Trump can still use ambiguous strategies to pressure opponents and wait for substantive concessions from them,” it continued. The Trump-ordered review, due April 1, is expected to guide whether the White House imposes further duties on China. In the meantime, Beijing has time to build a relationship with Trump,entertain him in the Chinese capitalor push for a preemptive deal to avert more severe economic penalties. The message from China’s top political echelon has been conciliatory. Chinese Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang last month told elites gathered in Davos that Beijing wants to “promote balanced trade” with the world, while Xi called for a “new starting point” in US-China ties. Beijing’s decision to complain to the WTO about the new tariffs underscores a key message from Chinese Communist Party propagandists: that China plays by global rules, while the US is the one who does not. Beijing has also defended its efforts to control exports of precursor chemicals for fentanyl and said the drug crisis is “America’s problem.” It remains to be seen whether China will announce more trade countermeasures in the days ahead. But its initial response to the 10% duty and messaging in recent weeks suggests that it may still be in a wait-and-see mode before digging too deeply into its toolbox of retaliatory measures. An opinion piece published by state broadcaster CCTV Sunday decried the “erroneous” tariffs while also calling for more cooperation between the two countries. Pundits within the country have downplayed the impact of the 10% tariffs – amid a larger debate about whether it would serve China to escalate a trade war like during the first administration. In 2018, Trump heightened or imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of Chinese imports to the US, with Beijing hitting back with whatanalysts saywere some $185 billion of its own tariffs on US goods. The Biden administration largely kept those duties in place, while focusing on its own so-called “small yard, high fence” approach to trade with China – placing targeted export controls on Chinese access to high tech that could have military applications. That saw Beijing unleash its own controls – limiting the export of certain critical minerals and related technologies that countries rely on to fabricate products from military goods to semiconductors. Late last year, the country revamped its export control regulations, sharpening its ability to restrict so-called dual-use goods. A ramping up of the use of these controls, as well as retaliatory tariffs, could be moves for Beijing in the weeks ahead or if Trump does levy higher tariffs in the coming months. Meanwhile, Beijing has already taken steps to insulate itself from some of the impacts of the tariffs, which Trump himself has admitted could bring “pain” for Americans – an admission that follows concerns from economists and members of Congress that Americans will bear the cost of the measures. The US imported $401 billion worth of goods from China, with a trade deficit of over $270 billion in the first 11 months of last year, according to US government data. That placed China behind only Mexico as a top source for goods imported to the US. Chinese state media on Sunday said the country’s exports to the US account for only 3% of their GDP and less than 15% of China’s total exports. “China has long been preparing less exposure to the US, diversifying in all ways, not just in terms of trading partners, investment, but also currencies and payment system,” Keyu Jin, associate professor of economics at the London School of Economics told CNN’s Fareed Zarakia during the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. “The tariffs will hurt both countries. But you’ve seen already a gradual kind of redirection of trade to other countries (from Chinese companies),” Jin said. China sees “Trump as somebody who they can negotiate with, that there’s room for negotiation,” she added.\n",
            "Over the past three years, Elon Musk has met dozens of times with presidents, prime ministers, lawmakers, government officials and political candidates from around the world. Some of these meetings have been highly publicized, like his visit to Israel with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following criticism over an antisemitic post Musk boosted on X. Other meetings, such as a recent conversation with Argentine President Javier Milei, the world only glimpses through the billionaire’s social media posts. Known topics of conversation ranged from business opportunities for Musk’s companies to elections and policy issues such as trade, energy, education and population management, according to a CNN review of Musk’s meetings, calls and conversations with political figures around the world since August 2021. Although some of his relationships with those leaders go back even further, in that time, Musk has gone from being one of the world’s wealthiest and most influential businessmen to an increasingly powerful player in global affairs. Taken together, the meetings show how Musk has been courted not only for his companies and deep pocketbook but also for his ability to impact the course of wars through hisStarlink satellite service;his opinion onartificial intelligence,the next major wave of technology development; and his role inswaying public opinionthrough his platform, X. On Friday, the Wall Street Journalreportedthat Musk has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian government officials, including about Starlink, since late 2022. CNN has not independently confirmed the conversations, so they are not included in our analysis. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN the report was “absolutely false.” He said Musk and Putin have only ever spoken once, adding that the conversation was over the phone and took place before 2022. Musk’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. For Musk, conversations with world leaders are a virtuous cycle: The six prominent companies he owns or runs give him an in with those figures, whose support often fuels their growth. In turn, those leaders’ interest in attracting Musk’s business provides an opportunity for him to advise on some of his other pet interests, such as global birth rates and immigration. At the same time, the South Africa-born billionaire has become a political power player in his adopted home, the United States. He held livestream campaign events on X for presidential hopefuls Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who both later dropped out of the race, as well as formerPresident Donald Trump.Musk has since thrown his weight — and tens of millions of dollars — behind Trump, attending and hosting rallies on his behalf and criticizing (and, in some cases, spreading false information about) his competitor, Vice President Kamala Harris, on X. “He’s trying to be a global influencer, and I guess he’s decided he needs to do more than use X,” said James Lewis, director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Of course, it’s not unusual for corporate leaders to sometimes meet with government officials, and Musk is not the only big business name to publicly weigh in on the upcoming US presidential election. But the extent of Musk’s public political involvement is unusual for the chief executive of a public company like Tesla — as well as the owner of several powerful private firms, executive leadership experts told CNN. “What’s different about it is that there’s a political aspect, and most CEOs steer clear of politics,” Lewis said. “They’re going to the head of another state, basically, to make the commercial conditions better for their product, maybe to lobby on a certain point, but they don’t usually do politics,” he said, adding that with Musk, “there’s a political tone to everything he does.” At least some of Musk’s political relationships appear to have benefited his companies. In May 2022, Muskmetwith the then-President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, to mark the launch of Starlink in the country, a major new market for the satellite business. In February 2023, he heldcallswith then-Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador about a new Tesla manufacturing plant in the state of Nuevo Leon, for which the company later received $153 million worth of incentives from the state. In May 2023, he held meetings with Chinese government officials shortly after Tesla announced plans for anew battery plantin Shanghai; Musk made asurprise returnto China this April for a visit with Premier Li Qiang, weeks before the company broke ground on the facility. Even more world leaders, includingFrench President Emmanuel Macron,Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoganandIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have met with Musk to ask Tesla to invest in their countries. CNN’s analysis includes only meetings for which at least some information is publicly available. It’s possible the billionaire has calls or meetings with leaders that he does not post about. “One might say he doesn’t have to pay lobbyists, because he’s his own lobbyist, globally,” said William Klepper, a professor of management at Columbia Business School who focuses on executive leadership. But, he added, “when you’ve got other people’s money at stake, you have to moderate your activities … when you get into these extremes, you can impact your business.” Musk has not hesitated to deal in extremes. He’swarnedof the downfall of America if Democrats are elected, pushed falseconspiracy theorieson topics such as mail-in voting and warned in public events of a “woke mind virus” that threatens society’s advancements. Separately, Musk has also taken heat for boosting anantisemitic conspiracy theory, racist false claims aboutimmigrationand the dangerous‘Pizzagate’conspiracy, as well as posting aHolocaust jokeon X. Recently, Musk’s political activism has begun to have a tangible impact on his companies: Brands pulled their advertisements from X,tanking its value.And SpaceX earlier this monthsued a California regulatorafter it allegedly denied a bid to allow more rocket launches over the billionaire’s controversial comments, claiming it had violated Musk’s freedom of speech. (The agency did not comment on the suit.) CNN’s analysis also suggests that Musk has, in particular, worked to develop influence among a set of right-leaning world leaders, including Modi, Bolsonaro, Milei and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. “He’s probably more comfortable with them … these are people who want to meet with him, and not everyone wants to meet with Elon Musk,” Lewis said. “It’s birds of a feather. He likes visiting people who are going to be pleased to be receiving Elon Musk.” During a conference for Italy’s far-right Brothers of Italy party last year, Musk railed against “illegal immigration” and the “woke mind virus” that he said was gripping the US. Musk called it “evil” and warned of it moving to Italy. India’s Modi, who was recentlyreelectedfor a rare third consecutive term, used his plans for electric vehicle manufacturing growth — including conversations with Musk about a potential Tesla factory — as acampaign talking point, although a meeting in India between the two men earlier this year where Musk was expected to announce the facility was rescheduled. Musk has also met with Milei multiple times in his first year leading Argentina, during which time the president hasfaced protestsover a huge spike in poverty rates as a result of austerity measures. “I recommend investing in Argentina,” Musk said in anX postfollowing a May meeting between the pair. In anotherpostlast month, Musk said, “Milei is bringing prosperity to Argentina.” (Argentina is home tohuge stores of lithium, an essential component in batteries like the ones used in Tesla’s cars.) Now, as he campaigns for Trump, Musk may be setting himself up for his most prominent political role yet: a position in a possible future Trump White House. Musk and Trump have publicly discussed having the billionaire lead a new government efficiency commission — which Musk has jokingly referred to as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, the name of Musk’s favorite meme and cryptocurrency — if the former president is reelected. Methodology:CNN’s analysis is based on information compiled from news reports, X posts and press releases. It is possible other meetings exist, or other topics were discussed beyond what is publicly available. The position titles are as of the time of the meeting.\n",
            "President Donald Trump has called for an expansive, next-generationmissile defense shieldfor the mainland United States, something modeled on Israel’s formidable defenses, typified by its signature Iron Dome system. A defensive dome for the US – a country hundreds of times the size of Israel – would require massive scale, as well as space-based interceptors, and almost certainly be decades away. Yeton the piece of US soil perhaps most vulnerable to missile attacks – the Pacific island of Guam – work is well underway on the kind of multi-layered missile defense that could point the way. However, experts say even that faces steep challenges. “There are no fast or panacea solutions, and we are making the decisions late in the game even though visionary military and political leaders saw this coming in the 1990s,” said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center. The US territory of Guam, a 210-square-mile island in the Pacific Ocean, is home to just under 175,000 people. It also hostsAndersen Air Force Base– a key deployment base for US Air Force bombers such as the B-1 and B-52 and sometimes the stealthy B-2 – and is homeport to US nuclear attack submarines that could be vital in any defense of Taiwan. The island is less than 1,900 miles (3,000 kilometers) from China (PRC) and 2,100 miles from North Korea. Mockups of it have shown up inChina’s military propaganda videos, and North Korea has made threats against it. But the US military has not stood still, advancing its ability to defend against regional threats. Just last December, the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA) conducted the first successful intercept of a ballistic missile target from the island using the Aegis Guam System, which fired a land-based interceptor of the type that US Navy ships have used to destroy ballistic missile targets in testing. “Current forces are capable of defending Guam against today’s North Korean ballistic missile threats. However, the regional threat to Guam, including those from PRC, continues to rapidly evolve,” the MDA’s director for operations, Michelle Atkinson, said in 2023. In the December test, a US Air Force C-17 plane released a medium-range ballistic missile target off Guam’s coast. After the target was tracked by powerful radar, an interceptor was fired from a Vertical Launch System on the island, taking it out outside Earth’s atmosphere, according to releases by MDA and Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer of the Aegis system on Guam. It was a “a critical milestone in the defense of Guam and the region,” said US Navy Rear Adm. Greg Huffman, commander, Joint Task Force-Micronesia. But the intercept test went beyond the land-based Aegis system, with other military elements testing systems that would form key parts of the multi-layered concept Trump would like to see. That’s something akin to what Israel fields, a four-tiered system often lumped under the “Iron Dome” moniker, after its best-known and lowest layer. While the Iron Dome combats incoming rockets and artillery weapons, David’s Sling protects against short- and medium-range threats, and the Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems stop ballistic missiles. In a nod to a similarly layered defensive structure, US Indo-Pacific Command said it used December’s intercept to test tracking capabilities of the US Army’s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system based on Guam. THAAD is designed to stop incoming missiles in their terminal, or descent, phase of flight, while Aegis makes its intercept in the mid-course phase, outside Earth’s atmosphere, before the missiles dive on their target. The US military also employs Patriot missile batteries, designed to make much lower-altitude intercepts, as the final phase of Guam’s defense. Both the THAAD and Patriot systems have been successfully used in combat. All three – Aegis, THAAD and Patriot – will eventually form what is called the Enhanced Integrated Air and Missile Defense System (EIAMD) on Guam, which the MDA says will provide “360-degree coverage, and layered defense against regional ballistic, maneuvering ballistic, hypersonic glide, and cruise missile threats.” That system would also rely on input from US satellites and space-based sensors, according to the MDA, inching it closer to Trump’s missile defense vision. But the timeline for full Guam missile defense – expected to take at least a decade to put together – is indicative of the challenges in constructing any system to fight ballistic and hypersonic glide missiles. That’s not helped by constant technological advances in missile technology, which often evolves more quickly than ways to defend against it. And Trump’s concept of anext-generation missile defense for the continental US goes well beyond what is still years away on Guam, an island about 10 times the size of Manhattan. In his executive order, Trump said he would “direct(the US) military to begin construction of the great Iron Dome missile defense shield, which will be made all in the USA,” as the US faces a “catastrophic threat” from ballistic, cruise and hypersonic missiles. His ambitious executive order called for an acceleration in “the development and deployment of Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor Layers, proliferated space-based interceptors, a Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, capabilities to defeat salvoes prior to launch, non-kinetic missile defense capabilities, and underlayer and terminal-phase intercept capabilities.” Trump’s order does not give any estimate of the costs of such a system, but several hundreds of billions of dollars would probably be a conservative estimate. “The costs of reliably defending an area the size of the United States against a wide variety of threats at multiple different intercept points would be astronomical,” said Matt Korda, associate director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists. And as far as money goes, the advantage goes to the attacker. “Offense is cheaper than defense every single time,” Korda said. Even if US technology can develop and deploy all that Trump is asking for, impregnable missile defense could still prove impossible. Though it is touted by many as the world’s best missile defense, attacks by Iran last year showed that the Iron Done is far from unbeatable, with projectiles fired by Tehran and Houthi rebels landing in Israel. Iran achieved that by firing large numbers of weapons at Israel. While manyof thearound 180 missiles launchedwere intercepted, some got through. Missile defense experts have long pointed out that’s one way to beat any missile defense system. Schuster, a former US Navy captain who worked on the Aegis missile defense system in its early days, said missile defenses can be “saturated,” pointing out that the incoming ballistic missile knows where it’s going, but the interceptors have to be directed to their target. “You can only guide so many (interceptors) at any one time while the ballistic missile has an internal guidance system,” Schuster said. The problem for defenders becomes more difficult once warheads with “maneuverable reentry vehicles” – which can change directions after they reenter the atmosphere and approach targets from different directions – are added. Both China and Russia have such capabilities. “A target coming directly at you is the easiest to intercept. The greater the lateral displacement from that, the more challenging the intercept equation,” Schuster said. Adversaries can compound that problem by firing decoy missiles, which distract from more important targets – which if they involve nuclear warheads, could do catastrophic damage. Of course, all that comes into play once a system is actuallydeployed. And,according to Schuster, the biggest stumbling block for Trump’s shield plan could be a US production and procurement system that has been neglected –despite the early successes demonstrated on Guam. “Our production rates are criminally low in my opinion,” he said. “We have been asleep at the switch … for over a decade.” And it’s not just a manufacturing infrastructure problem, it’s also the limited knowledge and skills to produce them, Schuster said. “We are going to have to invest in both plant, which we do well, and people, which we don’t do well.”\n",
            "NBA superstarLuka Dončićhas revealed that he was as shocked as anyone to hear that theDallas Maverickswere trading him to theLos Angeles Lakersin one of the most stunning deals in NBA history. “Everyone was surprised, so you can imagine how surprised I was,” he said at a press conference introducing him as a Lakers player Tuesday. “I was almost asleep. So when I got a call, I had to check (whether) it was April 1, I didn’t really believe it at first. “It was a big shock. It was hard moments for me. (Dallas) was home, so it was really hard moments for me, especially the first day.” According to Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka, Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison approached him with the idea of a potential trade, with the two meeting for coffee in Dallas. The subsequent talks lasted three weeks, and the only people who knew about the potential trade were the two general managers and team ownership, Pelinka said. The Lakers and Mavericks completed the move on Sunday, with Anthony Davis moving in the opposite direction as part of a three-team trade with the Utah Jazz. Dončić was in the midst of his seventh season in Dallas, with career averages of 28.6 points, 8.7 rebounds and 8.3 assists. He led the Mavs to the NBA Finals in 2024. He hasn’t played since December 25, when he sustained a left calf injury. Pelinka told reporters Tuesday that Dončić is day to day. When asked how he felt toward his former team – in particular general manager Harrison – for the decision to trade him, he replied: “That’s their decision. So I have no comment on that. They made a decision. “I don’t know why. But that’s their decision. So I can do nothing about it.” There had been suggestions that the team wanted to move Dončić partly because of a potential reluctance to sign a super﻿max extension with Dallas. When asked whether anyone from his inner circle had suggested that might be the case, his answer was simple: “Absolutely not.” The 25-year-old did speak of his excitement at joining what he called “the greatest club in the world,” and revealed that he had already spoken to new teammate LeBron James. “He called me right away,” Dončić said. “We didn’t talk much, because he said, ‘I understand what you’re feeling.’ But that was really nice of him just to call me right away and welcome me to LA.” The five-time NBA All-Star also expressed his joy at the opportunity to line up alongside one of his heroes. “It’s like a dream come true. I always look up to him. There’s so many things I can learn from him. I’m just excited to learn everything, and now I get to play with him, so it’s an amazing feeling,” he said. “I think we both make our teammates better. I think our IQ is very high, so I think that’s going to help everybody.” Also speaking at the press conference, Pelinka added that he was delighted to be able to welcome Dončić, whom he called a “top three player in the universe,” to Los Angeles. “Luka Dončić joining forces with the Los Angeles Lakers is a seismic event in NBA history,” the GM said. “We have a 25-year-old global superstar that’s going to get on the stage of the most popular and influential basketball brand on the globe. When those two powerful forces come together, it brings basketball joy to the world, because that’s how Luka plays. He plays with joy.” However, he did concede that it was unlikely that he would be able to add a championship-level big man to the roster to complement Dončić and James ahead of the trade deadline on Thursday. “We know we have a need for a big. The market for bigs right now, leading into the last two or three days of the trade deadline, is very dry. There’s just not a lot available,” Pelinka said. “So maybe we’ll be able to do some stuff around the margins. I would say, in terms of a big move for that position, it’s probably more realistic that that would be something that comes in the offseason.”\n",
            "When X unveiled its newest terms of service, which go into effect on November 15, users quickly picked up on one change. “By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to make your Content available to the rest of the world,” theterms of servicesaid, which includes the right to analyze any of that content “including, for example, for use with and training of our machine learning and artificial intelligence models, whether generative or another type.” Basically, by continuing to use the platform, users will agree that X can use their data to train its AI models. Using content to train AI has become a major issue as the technology booms. On X,artists and others in creative rolesare fretting about their work being used – not just on X – to train computers that could someday replace human creators entirely.OtherX users say they are concerned about personal information in their tweets being used that way. Some users said on the site they have already begundeleting photographs of themselvesfrom their feeds. And if users have any issue with those terms, they may end up in a federal courtroom that isfavored by conservative activistsand is already presiding overtwolawsuitsinvolving Musk-owned X. According to the update, all disputes related to the terms will be brought to the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas or state courts in Tarrant County, Texas. Tarrant County is more than 100 miles away from X’s new headquarters outside of Austin, Texas. X’s terms said any users who continue to use their products or services on or after November 15 would be agreeing to the updated terms. Grok, X’s AI chatbot, has already been embroiled in controversy, fromspreading false informationabout the 2024 election togenerating violent, graphic fake imagesof famous politicians. Companies fromGoogletoMicrosofthave similarlycome under fire for sometimes weird, completely off-baseAI tools. Before the most recent terms of service update, X users couldopt outof sharing data by going to “settings,” then “privacy and safety.” Under the “data sharing and personalization” header, there is a tab for“Grok,”where users can uncheck the box that allows the platform to use their data for AI training. But it’s not clear whether X’s new terms of service take away that option. X can now license all the content on the platform, including using it in its machine learning and artificial intelligence models. While such broad licensing with few limitations is not uncommon for a social media platform, Alex Fink, CEO and founder of Otherweb, an AI-based news reading platform that targets misinformation, told CNN that what makes X unique is that its new terms “remove any ambiguity” in contrast to other platforms that don’t spell out their intentions. Before, X said posts from private accounts would not be used to train Grok. But the language in the new terms of service does not differentiate between the types of accounts. But only time will tell if you may still be able to opt out, despite the new terms. Fink said it’s fairly common for a company’s legal terms to give it more leeway than its own menu options allow.
