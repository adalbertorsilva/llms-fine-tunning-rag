            "The second of five storms that will slam the eastern half of the United States with snow and ice over a two week period is on the way — and this one has more snowthan the first. The first storm unleasheddeadly severe weather, life-threatening flooding and dangerous ice and snow as it raced over the Midwest and Northeast Wednesday and Thursday. The next storm already slammed into the West Coast late Thursday and is racing east through the northern Rockies Friday.It will move so quickly that it will take less than 72 hours for it to go coast-to-coast, delivering heavy snow to the Midwest Saturday and the Northeast Saturday night and Sunday. More than 80 million people across the US are expected to be impacted by “a swath of disruptive & hazardous wintry weather” over the Super Bowl weekend, the National Weather Servicesaid. The storms are being driven by the jet stream, essentially a river of air in the atmosphere that storms flow through. It’s locked in an almost perfect line from west to east, and will continue to funnel fast-moving storms across the northern tier of the Lower 48. New storms will arrive every few days until the jet stream shifts — something that might not happen until mid-February. So more snow could pile up over the next two weeks in some parts of the East, including Boston and New York City, than happened in the past two winters combined. Snow from the next storm will begin early Saturday over the northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Precipitation will expand as the storm is boosted by atmospheric energy to its south. A mix of rain and freezing rain will stretch from Missouri to the central Appalachians by Saturday morning while snow falls over the Great Lakes. The storm will drop a widespread area of 3 to 6 inches of snow from central Minnesota through central Michigan. Lower snow totals are anticipated south of this streak of heavier snow: Chicago could end up with less than an inch of slush while Detroit sees an inch. It could be dry between the two areas of wintry precipitation Saturday morning in an area from Chicago to Cleveland. An icy mix will fill in these dry areas by the afternoon. A mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow will spread over Pennsylvania by Saturday evening. The same messy mix will spread through New Jersey, New York City and Long Island shortly after. Snow totals will climb higher than Thursday’s storm for much of New England and Upstate New York. At least 6 inches of snow is possible from central portions of New York to southern Maine and over much of southern New England. Snow totals could approach the double-digit mark from Syracuse, New York, to Boston. Boston could be buried by a foot of snow Saturday night and Sunday, which would be more snow than fell all of last winter. The city hasn’t had double-digit snowfall in a single day in just over three years. The storm will come to an end by mid-morning Sunday for much of the Northeast. Some snow could linger into the early afternoon in Maine and coastal New England. There will only be a brief lull in winter weather in the East to start next week before yet another storm. The exact timing and extent of next week’s winter weather is still coming into focus, but the wide-reaching storm could develop in the Plains as soon as Monday evening. It will strengthen and precipitation will envelop much of the eastern half of the US overnight Monday and Tuesday. It’s still unclear exactly how far north snow, sleet and freezing rain could spread, but anywhere from the Mississippi and Tennessee valleys north into the Midwest and Northeast could be in the storm’s path. Another very similar storm could develop in the Plains just after midweek. Next week’s first storm will influence how this one develops and moves, so we won’t know more specific forecast details until next week. That’s not all. Another cross-country storm could develop next weekend and bring more snow and ice to the eastern half of the US. Snow totals will climb quickly as storm after storm hits the Northeast — something that hasn’t happened in the region in recent years. Boston should record about 3 feet of snow each winter but less than 2 feet fell in the past two winters combined. This upcoming stretch could bring 1 to 2 feet of snow to the city, depending on each storm’s ultimate track. A similar scenario could unfold in New York City. Less than 10 inches of snow blanketed the city in the past two winters but that amount could pile up during this busy stretch. CNN Meteorologist Brandon Miller and Taylor Ward contributed to this report.\n",
            "The comings and goings atGreenland’s new international airportin its capital Nuuk look a bit different of late, as journalists like me come here to see what all the fuss is about. The fuss, of course, is the result ofUS President Donald Trump’s interest in taking controlof the massive island that is geographically part of North America but legally is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, a member of NATO, the European Union, and a US ally. I wanted to drill down on what’s here, what makes it attractive and whether the local population is welcoming or hesitant about being in Trump’s sights. “Greenland is the front door for North America,” said Tom Dans, leaning into the arguments of Greenland’s importance to US national security. I’d wanted to speak to Dans, a private equity investor with prospective interests in the Arctic who campaigned for Trump, but I hadn’t expected to see him at the airport. To be fair, Dans wasn’t hard to spot. He’s a tall Texan with one of those wide shiny smiles wealthy Americans tend to have. He was also wearing a baseball cap emblazoned with the American flag. He didn’t have more time to chat then, so I stepped outside, into the 14 Fahrenheit (-10 Celsius) cold that was, I would learn, balmy compared to what was to come later in the week. My CNN colleague Neil Bennett and I trudged through the snow to the back of a long line for taxis. “You are here because Trump,” remarked a woman waiting in front of us. Not yet accustomed to the Nordic tone, I couldn’t quite tell if this was meant as a simple statement or an accusation. “We are,” I dutifully confirmed. “They want more tourists to come here, they need to get more taxis,” she said. We needn’t worry too much though, she explained, we wouldn’t be waiting in the cold for too long. Despite the apparent shortage of taxis, they can’t go very far and return quickly. The trip to the center of Nuuk from the airport is about 4 miles — and then the roads just stop. There is nowhere else to go, at least by car. Greenland — three times the size of Texas — has only about 56 miles of paved roads. She introduced herself as Lisbeth Højdal, a consultant from Denmark who was here to run a course training career counselors. The Danish government provides Greenland a grant ofabout $500 millionevery year to support health, education and other services here. Højdal’s course was part of that package of support. So, before I’d even had a chance to look around, I’d heard the views of outsiders — one American, one Dane. But Greenlanders have many different views. “We have always been told that Denmark is the big savior of Greenland,” Qupanuk Olsen recalls. The Danes, she says, look down on her and fellow native Greenlandic people who are Inuit: “You guys cannot stand on your own feet; you guys don’t have anything without us. You can’t study, you don’t have health care, you have nothing without us.” Olsen is known as “Greenland’s biggest influencer” with more than a million subscribers combined acrossYouTube,TikTokandInstagramwhere she shows the world the best of Greenlandic, and specifically Inuit, culture. For an introduction to that culture, she brings me to see the “Mother of the Sea” — a striking stone sculpture on Nuuk’s rocky coast, depicting Sedna, the goddess of the sea in the Inuit religion. At high tide the statue is partially submerged. Inuits (sometimes incorrectly referred to as “Eskimos”) make up almost 90% of Greenland’s population of 57,000. We walk a few steps away from the shoreline and the “Mother of the Sea,” and Olsen points to the top of a hill and another figure, “I really want this statue gone.” The statue, which looks over all of Nuuk, is of Hans Egede, an 18th-century Dano-Norwegian missionary who brought Christianity to the island. “Why should he be up there? Why isn’t it a Greenlander up there?” Olsen asks. “We Greenlanders should be more proud of who we are … not celebrate some foreigner who came here and changed our culture and colonized us.” Danish control of Greenland dates to the time of Egede. Greenland was granted home-rule in 1979 and, after a referendum in 2008, the island was allowed more self-governing powers including the ability to hold a referendum on independence (though independence would also require approval from the Danish parliament.) But despite the increased autonomy, for Olsen the statue of Egede is a daily reminder of Danish colonization — something she purposefully talks about in the present tense. “I used to be a royalist. I used to look up to the Danish people and thought they were better than me. Now, I’ve really realized that’s not the case,” she says. She points toabuses of Greenland’s native people. In the 1960s and 70s, doctors placed IUD contraceptives in young Inuit girls without their or their parents’ consent as a means of population control. An investigation by Danish and Greenlandic officials into what has become known as “the spiral case” is expected to finish this year. “I should have a lot more cousins,” Olsen says. Another practice known as “legally fatherless” allowed Danish men who impregnated unmarried women in Greenland to skirt any responsibilities for their child. Olsen says her mother was one of the “legally fatherless” children born here. In recent weeks, Denmark has announceda boost in Arctic defense spendingand the Danish king revealeda new designfor the royal coast of arms, making far more prominent the symbols for Greenland and the Faroe Islands (also part of the Kingdom of Denmark.) But it’s too little, too late, says Olsen, who supports independence for Greenland and is standing in upcoming elections. She acknowledges an independent Greenland would need to sign new agreements with other countries for defense of its 27,000 miles of coastline, and other arrangements when it comes to trade and financial support, but for her that’s no reason to jump from Danish control to American. “Why should I? I’m so proud of who we are as Inuit,” she says. “Why should we just be taken by another colonizer?” The US already has strong connections with and interest in Greenland. Climate change and the loss of sea iceis opening up new shipping routesbetween the US and Europe; Greenland is rich in oil and gas as well as rare earth minerals needed for modern development — a market currently controlled by China. A US base inside the Arctic Circle in the far northwest of the island gives the US Space Force “Space Superiority,”the military says. For Tom Dans, the tall Texan with the wide smile, the logical next step is for Greenland to come even closer to Washington. As we walked along the pier at Nuuk’s frozen harbor — where fishing boats with reinforced hulls, some equipped with harpoons for whaling, broke through the ice — I asked him if we were in the 51st state of the US. “I don’t think so. This is Greenland,” Dans said, before adding with a laugh, “If we werein Canada, perhaps.” Dans has no current role in the Trump administration, but was appointed to the US Arctic Research Commission, an independent federal advisory committee, during the first Trump term. He says he’s set up “American Daybreak,” which he describes as “a nonprofit working to build US-Greenlandic relations.” He also has a personal connection to Greenland. After the Nazis invaded Denmark during World War II, the US stepped up to help to protect Greenland, and Dans’ grandfather was part of that effort as a merchant mariner. When we met, Dans had just traveled to Narsarsuaq, near the southern tip of Greenland, to commemorate the anniversary of the Nazi torpedoing of the US Army Transport Dorchester with the loss of almost 700 lives in 1943. Dans gestured toward a Danish Royal Navy vessel moored in the harbor. The Danes provide some security for Greenland but in reality, their navy is too small and the United States is again the main force protecting the island, he said. It’s an argument he’s also made on the show of a former Trump adviser, Steve Bannon. “Part of what is really important today, in the moment, is for Americans and the rest of the world to realize how closely intertwined our country has been with Greenland for so long and why it’s so important,”he said in a live appearancefrom Narsarsuaq last Tuesday. Dans brought me to a café to meet Jørgen Boassen, a Greenlander nicknamed “Trump’s son.” Boassen achieved semi-celebrity status in the MAGA universe as Greenland’s biggest Trump supporter and was among those who welcomedDonald Trump Jr. when he visited Nuuklast month. He has made multiple trips to the US in recent months — attending the Trump victory party in Mar-a-Lago on election night and the inauguration. And just a few days into the new Trump administration — Boassen, Dans, and a Greenlandic politician visited the White House, wherethey posed with the Greenland flag. But even Boassen does not want Greenland to be taken over by the US. He doesn’t want to be subsumed as the 51st state, he says, but wants the US to be Greenland’s “best and closest ally with everything — with defense, mining, oil exploration, trade, everything.” Not all Greenlanders want to break free from Denmark. “We might be ready someday, but not today, not tomorrow,” says Aqqalu C. Jerimiassen, the leader of Atassut, a party in favor of staying within the Danish kingdom. He acknowledged the wrongs committed against native Greenlanders and said the Danes must accept responsibility. “Every colonizer has made mistakes,” he said.  “But we cannot live in the past.” Atassut, which describes itself as a “moderate conservative” party, supports universal health care, free education, and other forms of welfare that are basic concepts across much of Europe, and which Denmark provides for Greenland. He says while some here “very much would like to be US citizens and would like to follow the American dream,” most would not be in favor of joining the United States and losing universal access to these services. Greenland is holding elections next month that may reveal more about its population’s views about future relationships with the world. And the parliament just fast-tracked a law banning foreign political funding. That’s fine by Højdal — the Danish guidance counselor I met at the airport — who said Greenland’s future is for Greenland, not anyone else, to decide. As she watches the news coming from the United States of the hectic first weeks of the second Trump administration, she says a Turkish proverb comes to mind. “When a clown enters a castle, he doesn’t become a king. The castle becomes a circus.” Greenland, she hopes, doesn’t become a circus.\n",
            "TheAga Khan IVwas laid to rest on Sunday at a private ceremony in Aswan, Egypt. The death of Prince Karim – the 49th hereditary imam of the Shiite Ismaili Muslims – was announced Tuesday by the Aga Khan Development Network and the Ismaili religious community. His son, 53-year-old Rahim Al-Hussaini, has been named as the Aga Khan V, the spiritual leader of the world’s millions of Ismaili Muslims, in according with his father’s will. On Saturday, a private funeral service took place at the Ismaili community center in Lisbon attended by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Spain’s King Emeritus Juan Carlos and Portugal’s President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. The Aga Khan is considered by his followers to be a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad and is treated as a head of state. The governor of Aswan welcomed Prince Karim’s family at the southern Egyptian’s provinces airport on Saturday. “When his will was opened, it was found that he had requested to be buried in Aswan near his grandfather, Sultan Muhammad Shah, and his grandmother, Om Habiba,” said Maj. Gen. Ismail Kamal. Ismaili mourners marched as bells rang during the burial ceremony in the country’s southern Aswan province, as Prince Karim’s body was taken in a van. They carried his body, draped in a white shroud, and placed it on a yacht on the Nile River. Prince Karim, 88, was given the title of “His Highness” by Queen Elizabeth in July 1957, two weeks after his grandfather, the Aga Khan III, unexpectedly made him heir to the family’s 1,300-year dynasty as leader of the Ismaili Muslim sect. The late Aga Khan evolved over decades into a business magnate and a philanthropist, moving between the spiritual and the worldly with ease. He was a defender of Islamic culture and values, but also widely regarded as a builder of bridges between Muslim societies and the West. The Aga Khan Development Network deals mainly with issues of health care, housing, education and rural economic development. It says it works in over 30 countries and has an annual budget of about $1 billion for nonprofit development activities. Ismailis lived for many generations in Iran, Syria and South Asia before also settling in east Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East, as well as Europe, North America and Australia more recently. They consider it a duty to donate up to 12.5% of their income to the Aga Khan as steward.\n",
            "Israel completed its withdrawal from theNetzarim Corridoron Sunday, a militarized zone that splits Gaza in half, as part of its commitments under a ceasefire agreement with Hamas. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians havefiled through the area, many of them returning decimated homes in the north, by foot, car and in some cases, by donkeys. People traveling through the corridor must still navigate a checkpoint and the destruction wrought by 15 months of Israeli bombardment. “I was displaced a long time ago. I have seen people arriving on this road, sometimes even sleeping on it while waiting for the Israeli army to withdraw,” said Osama Saleem, who was waiting for his vehicle to be inspected. “I hope the Israeli army withdraws from all of Gaza and that life returns to normal,” he added. Hamas said in a statement that Israeli forces had fully withdrawn from the corridor, a six-kilometer strip of land that separates the north of the territory from the south and stretches from the Israel-Gaza border to the Mediterranean Sea. Named after the former Israeli settlement of Netzarim in Gaza, the corridor wasconstructed and occupied by the Israeli militaryto create a strategic, central road intersecting the enclave. “The withdrawal of the Zionist occupation army from the Netzarim axis is a victory for the will of our people,” a Hamas statement issued Sunday said. There has been no confirmation from Israel, but reporters working for CNN on the ground said there were no Israeli forces present at the crossing on Sunday. Israel had used the corridor as a zone of occupation during its 15-month assault on Gaza. Its troops began withdrawing from Netzarim Corridor two weeks ago as part of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement. In the first 72 hours after Israeli forces opened the corridor, around 500,000 displaced Palestinians — almost a quarter of Gaza’s population — had made the journey tothe decimated north, according to the Gaza Government Media Office. Israel retains its presence along Gaza’s borders with Egypt and Israel. A checkpoint run by Egyptian and Qatari officials — countries that play a mediator role between the warring sides — remains at Netzarim. Israel’s complete withdrawal from Netzarim is part of its commitment to the ceasefire and hostage agreement, which on Saturday saw the release of three Israeli hostages and 183 Palestinian prisoners. So far, 16 out of a total of 33 hostages expected to be released in the first — and current — phase of the deal have been freed. Separately, hours after Israel troops withdrew from the corridor, Israel forces opened fire near Nahal Oz, an Israeli kibbutz that lies close to the Gaza border - and was attacked during the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023 - killing three Palestinians, Palestinian authorities said. Others were wounded in the incident, Gaza’s Civil Defense said, without specifying how many people had been injured. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it fired warning shots towards “suspects” who had approached the border fence in northern Gaza, and that “several hits were identified,” without acknowledging whether any civilians were killed or if any actually entered the buffer zone area. Following the incident, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said: “Anyone who enters the buffer zone, their blood is on their own head — zero tolerance for anyone who threatens IDF forces or the fence area and communities.” It comes as negotiations on the second and third phases of the ceasefire and hostages agreement are mired in uncertainty. Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahuhas been deeply wary of phase two of the deal, which would see the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the return of the remaining hostages there. His finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has pledged to quit the government if the ceasefire continues. A “mid-level” Israeli delegation arrived in Doha on Sunday to discuss “technical details” of the deal but will not discuss the second phase of the agreement, an Israeli official told CNN. The delegation to Doha includes the Coordinator for Hostages and Missing Persons Brigadier General (Res.) Gal Hirsch and representatives from the Mossad intelligence agency, Shin Bet security agency, and the Israeli military. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – who returned to Israel Sunday from his trip to the United States – is expected to hold a security-political cabinet meeting about the second phase of the deal on Tuesday, the source told CNN. Upon his return, Netanyahu convened a cabinet meeting where he spoke about his visit. “I just returned from a historic visit to Washington with President (Donald) Trump and his senior administration officials, along with Senate and Congressional leaders. This visit and the discussions we had with the US president carry with them tremendous additional achievements that can ensure Israel’s security for generations,” Netanyahu said. The prime minister also seemingly addressed the incident that happened across the border from Nahal Oz. “We are enforcing the ceasefire agreements. This requires us to act with force to enforce them. We are doing this both in the south and in the north,” Netanyahu said. “My instruction this evening is – no one is to approach the perimeter, and no one is to infiltrate the perimeter.” Netanyahu also called US President Donald Trump’s plan to take Gaza under American control a “revolutionary, creative vision.” At a joint press conference speaking alongside Netanyahu at the White House last week, Trump said the United States would take ownership of Gaza and redevelop it into a “Riviera of the Middle East.” “For a whole year, we’ve been told that in the ‘day after,’ we need the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) in Gaza, the Palestinian Authority,” the Israeli leader said. “President Trump came with a completely different vision, much better for the state of Israel. A revolutionary, creative vision – and we are discussing it. He is very determined to implement it. This also opens up many possibilities for us.” Meanwhile, in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian health authorities said Israeli forces shot and killed a woman who was eight months pregnant. Sundus Jamal Muhammad Shalabi, 23, was killed in the Nur Shams refugee camp, according to the Palestinian health ministry, who said that her husband was also shot and critically injured. CNN has approached the Israeli military for comment. Israeli military incursions in the northern West Bank targeting the cities of Jenin, Tulkarm and Tubas have severely restricted Palestinians’ access to essential services and caused widespread destruction, the United Nations said on Thursday. The operation, which started shortly after the ceasefire in Gaza began — now includes the Nur Shams refugee camp, according to the Israeli military. In a Telegram post Sunday, the IDF said that they “began operating overnight to thwart terrorism in Nur al-Shams,” and had “targeted several terrorists and arrested additional wanted individuals in the area.” This story has been updated with additional reporting. Khader Al-Za’anoun of Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, and CNN’s Kara Fox contributed reporting.\n",
            "The Taliban suspended the operation of Afghanistan’s only nationwide women’s radio station after raiding its premises on Tuesday, deepening the exclusion of women from public life and society since the group took power in 2021. Kabul-based Radio Begum – a station run by women with content aimed at women’s education – said officers from the Taliban’s information and culture ministry restrained the station’s staff as it searched its premises in the nation’s capital. Officers “seized computers, hard drives, files and phones from Begum staff, including Begum female journalists, and took into custody two male employees of the organization who do not hold any senior management position,” the station said in a statement on Tuesday. The ministry later confirmed the station’s suspension, citing several alleged violations of “broadcasting policy and improper use of the station’s license,” including “the unauthorized provision of content and programming to a foreign-based television channel.” It did not identify the foreign TV channel in question, but said it will determine the station’s future “in due course.” Reporters Without Borders (RSF), an independent rights group,condemnedthe suspension and demanded its immediate reversal. Before Tuesday’s ban,Radio Begumbroadcast six hours of lessons a day, along with health, psychology and spiritual programs to women across most of Afghanistan. The station said it provides education to Afghan girls and support to Afghan women, without being “involved in any political activity whatsoever.” Its sister channels also offer lessons online filmed in studios thousands of miles away in Paris. The televised classes cover a wider array of subjects, providing education in a country where girls arebanned from schoolafter sixth grade. The Taliban, a radical Islamist group not recognized by most countries around the world, has been tightening its grip on the media landscape since its takeover more than three years ago. Initially presenting itself as more moderate than during its previous rule of Afghanistan in the 1990s, it even promised that women would be allowed to continue their education up to university. But it has sincecracked down instead,closingsecondary schools for girls;banning women from attending university, working in most sectors andat NGOs, including the United Nations; restricting their travel without a male chaperone; and banning them from public spaces such as parks and gyms. Last year, the Talibanclosed at least 12 media outlets, both public and private, according to RSF, which ranked Afghanistan178 out of 180 countriesin its latest press freedom index. The Islamist regime alsobanned the sound of women’s voicesin public – including singing, reciting, or reading aloud – under a strict set of “vice and virtue” laws that made it even harder for Radio Begum to reach its female audience.

            "Libya authorities uncovered nearly 50 bodies this week from two mass graves in the country’s southeastern desert, officials said Sunday, in the latest tragedy involving people seeking to reach Europe throughthe chaos-stricken North African country. The first mass grave with 19 bodies was found Friday in a farm in the southeastern city of Kufra, the security directorate said in a statement, adding that authorities took them for autopsy. Authorities posted images on its Facebook page showing police officers and medics digging in the sand and recovering dead bodies that were wrapped in blankets. The al-Abreen charity, which helps migrants in eastern and southern Libya, said that some were apparently shot and killed before being buried in the mass grave. A separate mass grave with at least 30 bodies was also found in Kufra after raiding a human trafficking center, according to Mohamed al-Fadeil, head of the security chamber in Kufra. Survivors said nearly 70 people were buried in the grave, he added. Authorities were still searching the area. Migrants’ mass graves are not uncommon in Libya. Last year, authorities unearthed the bodies ofat least 65 migrantsin the Shuayrif region, 350 kilometers (220 miles) south of the capital, Tripoli. Libya is the dominant transit point for migrants from Africa and the Middle East trying to make it to Europe. The country plunged into chaos following a NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime autocrat Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Oil-rich Libya has been ruled for most of the past decade by rival governments in eastern and western Libya, each backed by an array of militias and foreign governments. Human traffickers have benefited from more than a decade of instability, smuggling migrants across the country’s borders with six nations, including Chad, Niger, Sudan Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia. Once at the coast, traffickers pack desperate migrants seeking a better life in Europe into ill-equipped rubber boats and other vessels for risky voyages on the perilous Central Mediterranean Sea route. Rights groups and U.N. agencies have for years documented systematic abuse of migrants in Libya including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture. The abuse often accompanies efforts to extort money from families before migrants are allowed to leave Libya on traffickers’ boats. Those who have been intercepted and returned to Libya — including women and children — are held in government-run detention centers where they also suffer from abuse, including torture, rape and extortion, according to rights groups and UN experts.\n",
            "As the Midwest and Northeast dig out from back-to-back winter storms, new systems are building and are expected to dump more snow from the middle of the country to the East Coast this week. Plenty of cold air remains in place to the north, helping to set the stage for a wide band of wintry mix and snow, according to the Weather Prediction Center. The first storm will form in the Central US Monday night and ramp up as it heads east, bringing snow and freezing rain to parts of the Appalachian Mountains, mid-Atlantic and southern portions of the Northeast Tuesday through Wednesday. The worst conditions are expected across the Appalachian Mountains from Northwestern North Carolina into Southwestern Virginia, with ice over 0.25 inches expected, which could cause downed tree limbs, power outages and travel headaches. Snow is more likely through the I-95 corridor from Richmond to Philadelphia, including Washington, DC, which is already under a winter storm watch Tuesday into Wednesday and could see 4-6 inches. The district has already seen more snowfall this year than the last two years combined, with more on the way. Then, on the heels of the first storm of the week, another will move in quickly behind it. The storm will start in the Central Plains Tuesday evening through Wednesday, where heavy snow is possible for cities like Kansas City, while Oklahoma City and Springfield, Missouri, could see freezing rain. A winter storm watch for Wednesday and Thursday has already been posted across much of northern Kansas and Missouri. Snowfall across the I-70 corridor could exceed 5 inches, and Kansas City could potentially see 4-8 inches of snowfall. This storm’s effects will spread to the Great Lakes for Wednesday and could bring snowfall to cities like Chicago and St. Louis. The current forecast for the second storm calls for rainfall to be the most likely form of precipitation for the major metropolitan cities across the Northeast. Kansas Gov. Laura Kellyissueda verbal state of disaster emergency proclamation on Sunday due to incoming winter weather expected to hit the state as early as Monday evening. “As I did during past storms, I urge all Kansans to take measures to make sure their families are ready by making a home emergency kit and emergency plan,” Kellysaid. Below-normal temperatures are likely to be recorded across much of the continental US over the next few weeks, the weather service said. This combination of active weather and prolonged cold may cause a continued stretch of winter disruption for many Americans. Here are the projected weather impacts for major cities as the storms move across the country. The first storm will affect the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast while the second will affect the Central US: A third storm is set to hit the West Coast late Wednesday, bringing a threat of heavy rain to Southern California on Thursday. In Ventura Country, the rain could trigger life-threatening debris flows in burn scar areas from January’s wildfire. The Weather Prediction Center has issued a level 2 out of 4 risk for excessive rainfall, threatening more than 34 million people across Central and Southern California Thursday, including Sacramento, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles. By the weekend, the storm is expected to move east, bringing additional weather risks to the Central and Eastern US. Parts of the Northeast woke up to more than a foot of snow Sunday morning, as a fast-moving winter storm, packing snow, sleet and ice, sped across the Midwest into the Northeast over theweekend. More than 15 million people from the Midwest to the Northeast were under winter alerts while the storm moved through. Those warnings have now expired. While the snow has mostly come to an end, travelers are experiencing delays due to the weather, and officials are warning people to watch out for snow-covered, slippery roads. As fans madetheir way into New Orleans for Super Bowl Sunday, dense fog in the area caused reduced visibility in several locations, the National Weather Service warned, urging drivers to exercise extreme caution on roadways. More than 400 flights into or out of the US were canceled Sunday, with another 3,800 flights delayed, according to the flight tracking websiteFlightAware. Parts of New York state, Wisconsin and Vermont received more than a foot of snow since it began falling Saturday, while states from Minnesota to Maine saw between 2.5 to 11 inches. Snow-covered and slippery roads could cause dangerous travel conditions, and areas with heavy ice could experience power outages and minor tree damage, the weather service said. In New York and Boston, crews worked Sunday to clear snow and ice from the roads. Boston had 41,000 tons of salt are on hand to treat streets blanketed by heavy snow, the city previously announced. The storm system moved in two rounds: The first brought heavy snow to the Midwest on Saturday afternoon, followed by significant snowfall in parts of the Northeast, coupled with icy conditions in the Appalachians. Along with the snowfall in the Midwest and Northeast, the storm brought icy conditions to the Appalachians. Three more systems are on the horizon through thisweekend, with another Arctic blast expected to push temperatures 10 to 20 degrees below seasonal norms across the Northeast. Meteorologists attribute this active pattern to the positioning of the jet stream, which is funneling storms across the northern US. The jet stream, essentially a river of air in the atmosphere that storms flow through, is locked in an almost perfect line from west to east and will continue to funnel fast-moving storms across the northern tier of the Lower 48. This pattern has been responsible for maintaining lower-than-average temperatures across much of the country this winter. New storms are expected to arrive every few days until the jet stream shifts – something that might not happen until the second half of February. This weekend’s storms are just part of what forecasters expect will be an active February for winter weather.\n",
            "An atmospheric river brought heavy rain, serious mountain snow and strong winds to California that flooded roads and rivers and triggered landslides, with at least two storm-related deaths reported – and more rain is on the way. The first storm, which impacted a large swath of the state, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento, tapered off on Wednesday. Northern California bore the brunt of the impacts, with reports of landslides and flooding in urban and low-lying areas. Two people were reported dead in Sonoma County due to the flooding, thesheriff’s office said. Rain coated Southern California’s Los Angeles County through Wednesday morning, maintaining the risk for debris flows and mudslides in areas still recovering from the devastating recent wildfires. Another atmospheric river-fueled storm with up to an inch of rain, which could renew those threats, arrived Thursday. But it’s expected to be less intense than previous storms, and the rain would be largely beneficial for the parched landscape to reduce the fire threat. The heaviest rainfall is forecast between midday Thursday and early Friday morning. Here are the latest impacts: Northern California bore the brunt of the storm Tuesday when a rain-saturated hillside in Forestville gave way, sending a house sliding into the Russian River near the Forest Hills Bridge, according toCNN affiliate KGO. The collapse was caused by heavy downpours and unstable soil. California Highway Patrol officers arrived at the scene around 12:30 p.m. to find land and trees sliding into the river, with the home already gone, KGO reported. “As we all know, the Russian River is a beautiful place, especially during the summer,” Sgt. Juan Valencia of the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office told the outlet. “But when we get these heavy rains, it’s very unpredictable.” Authorities confirmed the home dragged into the Russian River had been unoccupied at the time of the collapse, KGO reported. The storm has unleashed staggering rainfall totals, with Palmetto, some 17 miles east of Chico, recording 24.4 inches since Friday and areas like Sweetbriar and Brush Creek, 50 miles north of Redding, nearing or exceeding 22 inches. Redding’s 4.33 inches of rain on Sunday was its wettest February day on record, surpassing a century-old record set in 1914. San Francisco also broke a daily rainfall record Tuesday with 2.53 inches, eclipsing a record for the day set in 1887. The Russian River in Guerneville hit moderate flood stage early Wednesday, threatening homes, businesses and resorts in low-lying areas. Meanwhile, the Napa River, which had been rising rapidly Tuesday, peaked just over 24 feet before flood warnings were canceled. Officials warn high water levels could persist as streams and creeks continue draining into major rivers, keeping many areas at risk. Flood watches are in place north of the Bay Area from Thursday morning to Friday afternoon, where lower elevations could see up to an inch of rain and higher elevations could see two inches. These numbers aren’t as high as earlier storms – but soils are already saturated, so it wouldn’t take much to cause more flooding. The relentless rain has triggered landslides across California, forcing partial and full closures of key roadways. While crews work to assess damage and clear debris, some closures remain indefinite. California State Route 70 is among the most severely impacted, as a landslide near Quincy has closed indefinitely the highway between Jarbo Gap and the Greenville Wye, two mountain towns east of Chico and the Butte Valley. North of Greenville, California State Route 89 is operating under one-way traffic control due to landslide debris, while crews work to stabilize the area. In Stockton, flooding temporarily shut down the southbound lanes of California State Route 99 between Turner and Victor Road. Although the highway has since reopened, officials continue to monitor conditions closely. The Sierra Nevada has been buried under heavy snowfall, with multiple locations reporting more than a foot of snow – peaking at 32 inches of snow at California’s Donner Peak. Winter weather alerts are in place across the mountain range until Friday, when an additional one to three feet of snowfall is possible. Alerts are also in effect for parts of Cascades through Thursday morning. The storm has also brought significant snowfall to other parts of the West, including Idaho and Montana, where some areas have reported totals of 1 to 3 feet since the weekend. This storm will track across the country through the remainder of this week and into the weekend, reaching the Northern Rockies by late Friday. It will move to the Midwest on Saturday, then parts of the Mid-Atlantic that night. Snowfall in the Northeast will last into Sunday. CNN’s Taylor Romine contributed to this report\n",
            "Two new 591-foot-tall skyscrapers, linked across the top by a daring “sky pool,” are set to rise above Dubai’s Marasi Marina. But the soaring 43-foot infinity pool will not be accessible to the public, or even to most of the luxury towers’ residents — it’s part of what its architectsdescribeas an exclusive “ultra-penthouse.” Comprising 63 luxury residences, the new Regent Residences Dubai will be worth an estimated $1 billion upon its completion in 2027. The 35,000-square-foot penthouse features six bedrooms, a gym and a private elevator. The project’s other apartments, which all measure upwards of 6,500 square feet, will each occupy an entire floor. They were orientated to offer views of the marina and the nearbyBurj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building. And residents need not worry about missing out on the “sky pool”: All the apartments contain their own private swimming terraces (and access to another 82-foot indoor lap pool). A series of newly released renderings show the staggered pool terraces jutting out from the two towers’ facades. The design was “inspired by cascading water,” according to Foster + Partners, the architecture firm behind the project. Real estate company Sankari (which developed the project alongside IHG Hotels & Resorts)  declined to disclose to CNN how much the “ultra-penthouse” will cost, though the other residences start at $10 million each. Advertised as the “jewel in Dubai’s crown,” the luxury development also features 10 floating homes dubbed “water villas.” Residents will enjoy access to tennis and padel courts, outdoor lounges, a private cinema and virtual golf simulator, among much else. The podium at the base of the towers will meanwhile feature open green spaces, restaurants and retail space. The project is part of a majoroverhaulof the waterfront Marasi Marina neighborhood in Business Bay, a new high-rise development on the Dubai Creek, south of the city’s downtown area. It is Regent Residences’ first property in the Middle East. The two towers are not identical though they share “same design language,” according to Foster + Partners. In a press statement, the firm’s studio head Gerard Evenden said the project’s “dynamic twisting form and articulated facade” will make it “a distinctive new addition” to Dubai. Foster + Partners, which was founded by the celebrated architect — and winner of the Pritzker Prize, the profession’s equivalent to a Nobel —Norman Foster, has designed numerous other high-profile buildings in the United Arab Emirates in recent years. Among them are an 80-story Dubai skyscraper, called The Index, and the House of Wisdom, a library and culture center in Sharjah. The firm’s sculptural Zayed National Museum, which will serve as the centerpiece of Abu Dhabi’s new Saadiyat Island Cultural District, is due to open later this year. It is not the first time a swimming pool has been suspended between buildings:London’s see-through Sky Pool,built across the 10th stories of two residential towers, opened in the British capital’s Nine Elms neighborhood in 2021.\n",
            "At least 54 people were killed after a bus veered off a bridge into a ravine in Guatemala City on Monday, according to the country’s National Institute of Forensic Sciences. The bus was traveling across Belize Bridge in zone six of the Guatemalan capital when it plunged into the ravine, officials said Images of the wreckage posted on social media by emergency teams show the bus overturned and partially submerged in water. Debris can be seen scattered around the bus, both on the ground and in the water. Photos posted to social media by the Guatemalan army show several dead bodies lying on the bank of the ravine. In the early hours of Monday morning, emergency teams had to work in the dark to rescue people from the wreckage, using headlamps and flashlights to see, videos posted to X by the country’s volunteer firefighter service showed. Later, police officers, volunteer firefighters, municipal firefighters, members of the army and members of the Guatemalan Red Cross worked to recover bodies from the scene. Guatemala City’s Mayor, Ricardo Quiñonez Lemus,posted to Facebookthat he deployed “all emergency agencies to expedite rescue operations.” The President of Guatemala, Bernardo Arévalo, called the tragedy a “national pain,”writing on Xthat he stands ” in solidarity with the families of the victims who today woke up to heartbreaking news.” “Their pain is my pain,” he posted, declaring a period of national mourning. The Guatemalan Red Cross said in apost on Xthat it was providing psychological support to the family members of those who died in the accident.

            "It’s only three weeks into a fragile ceasefire, and Israel and Hamas are eachratcheting up allegations that the other party has violated the deal. So far, 16 out of 33hostagesscheduled for release in the current phase of the agreement have been freed by Hamas, and 656 Palestinian prisoners from a list of nearly 2,000 have been released by Israel. But the weekly exchanges may now be disrupted after Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement and said it would postpone Saturday’s hostage release “until further notice.” Israel has hit back, with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying late Tuesday that the Gaza ceasefire will end if Hamas does not release hostages as planned on Saturday. “If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon - the ceasefire will end, and the IDF will return to intense fighting until Hamas is completely defeated,” Netanyahu said in a video statement. US President Donald Trump, whose envoy helped mediate the agreement along with officials from Egypt and Qatar, has suggested dismissing the multi-staged approach of the deal altogether and giving Hamas an ultimatum to release all the hostages at once. Here’s what each side is saying, and where the deal could go from here: On Monday, Hamas threatened topostpone the next hostage release,accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire deal by targeting Palestinians with gunfire in various parts of Gaza, delaying the return of displaced people to the heavily bombarded north, and not allowing the agreed humanitarian aid to enter the enclave. The militant group also accused Israel of delaying the entry of essential medicines and hospital supplies, as well as not allowing tents, prefabricated houses, fuel, or rubble-removing machines into Gaza. On Tuesday, the Gaza health ministry said that 92 people in the enclave had been killed in Israeli military operations since the ceasefire came into effect. CNN has asked Israeli authorities for comment on the allegations regarding casualties and disrupted aid. A diplomat with knowledge of the ceasefire talks told CNN that the United Nations, Qatar and other countries had requested to deliver temporary shelters to Gaza but Israel turned them down. CNN has reached out to Israeli officials regarding the claim. Abu Obeida, a spokesman for Hamas’ armed wing, said in a social media post on Monday: “We affirm our commitment to the terms of the agreement as long as the occupation commits to them.” In a later statement, Hamas added that there was still an opportunity for the release to go forward as planned, saying that Israel has sufficient time “to fulfill its obligations.” Hamas’ postponement is a “complete violation of the ceasefire agreement and the deal to release the hostages,” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Monday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a meeting with his political and security cabinet on Tuesday, where they expected next steps. Katz said he instructed the military to “prepare at the highest level of alert for any possible scenario in Gaza.” The Israeli military also said it was raising the level of readiness in southern Israel and that it would reinforce the area to enhance its “readiness for various scenarios.” Those announcements also come after Israeli forces opened fire on Sunday in the eastern areas of Gaza City, close to the Gaza border, killing three Palestinians, Palestinian authorities said. The incident happened close to the border fence near Nahal Oz, an Israeli kibbutz, or agricultural commune. Following that incident, Katz said: “Anyone who enters the buffer zone, their blood is on their own head – zero tolerance for anyone who threatens IDF (Israel Defense Forces) forces or the fence area and communities.” Doubts about the future of the deal also follow Israel’s condemnation of thegaunt, frail appearance of the hostagesreleased last week as “shocking.” Many of the remaining Israeli hostages are believed to be in even worse condition, Israeli government officials told CNN on Tuesday. PresidentTrump has urged Israelto “let all hell break out” and cancel the ceasefire and hostages deal if Hamas does not return those still being held in Gaza by Saturday. “As far as I’m concerned, if all of the hostages aren’t returned by Saturday at 12 o’clock – I think it’s an appropriate time – I would say, cancel it and all bets are off and let hell break out,” the president told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday. Trump added that all hostages ought to be returned, not two or three “in drips and drabs,” which is the phased manner of releases outlined in the deal. Pressed on what “all hell” might entail in Gaza, Trump said, “You’ll find out, and they’ll find out – Hamas will find out what I mean.” Trump and his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff are part of the team that helped broker the ceasefire, which was finalized with cooperation between the Biden and Trump camps just before the new administration took office. The US president went on to say that Palestinians would not have a right to return to Gaza under hisplan to take US ownershipof the enclave and rebuild it. Trump also told reporters on Monday: “I think a lot of the hostages are dead.” More than 30 of the hostages are dead, according to Israel. On Tuesday, during a meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah, Trrump expressed doubt as to whether Hamas would meet the Saturday deadline. In short, no one knows. It took about a year of negotiations to reach the current deal. The first ceasefire, in November 2023, lasted about a week. Thecurrent agreementis set up to progress in three distinct phases, the first of which is already halfway through. As well as the release of 16 hostages so far, phase one has seen the entry of more humanitarian aid and thewithdrawal of Israeli troopsfrom parts of Gaza. The Israeli military has retained its presence along Gaza’s borders with Egypt and Israel. Israel has to date released around a third of the nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners agreed for the exchange, some of them held without charge, and others facing life sentences. Following Israel’s withdrawal from a key militarized zone dividing Gaza, Palestinians began returning to what’s left of their homes in theheavily bombarded north. The “overwhelming destruction of homes and communities in the north” has left people without viable shelter, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which has said “the need for food, water, tents and shelter materials in that area remains critical.” Meanwhile, negotiations for the second and third phases have barely started. An Israeli delegation was sent to Doha, Qatar, on Sunday, but an Israeli official told CNN that the team would not be discussing the second phase of the deal, adding that Netanyahu was planning separately to hold “a security-political cabinet meeting” this week regarding the second phase. Netanyahuwaited until last weekend – one week after a deadline for further ceasefire talks – to send his delegation to Qatar. Israeli media has speculated that he is simply running out the clock until phase one of the deal expires on March 1. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a key member of Netanyahu’s coalition, has threatened to quit the government if Israel doesn’t return to war after the first phase of the truce. Qatari and Egyptian mediators are engaging with Israel and Hamas to solve “current issues” and ensure adherence to the agreement, a diplomatic source familiar with the matter told CNN.\n",
            "Amid the maelstrom of indignation around Donald Trump’sproposal to “take over” Gaza, French President Emmanuel Macron has called for “respect” for Palestinians and their Arab neighbors, batting away the US president’s idea of a mass displacement of Gazans from their homeland. “You cannot say to 2 million people, ‘okay, now guess what? You will move,’” Macron told CNN in an exclusive interview recorded on Thursday at the Elysee Palace ahead of thisweek’s AI summit. “The right answer is not a real estate operation, this is a political operation,” he said. While France has been forthright in its support for Israel’s right to defend itself after Hamas’ October 7, 2023, massacre, Macron has not shied frompublicly decryingIsrael’s policies and conduct in its military operations in Gaza and Lebanon. France  suspended arms exports to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in October 2024, calling on other nations to follow suit. “I always reiterated my disagreement with (Israeli) Prime Minister Netanyahu,” Macron said. “I don’t believe, once again, that such a massive operation targeting sometimes civilian people is the right answer.” Macron said any “efficient” response to rebuilding Gaza “doesn’t mean automatically that you should lack respect to people or countries,” highlighting the wishes of Palestinians to remain on their homelands and the unwillingness of both Jordan and Egypt to accept large numbers of Gazan refugees. The provocative proposal lofted by Trump outlined a plan to remove Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Egypt and Jordan, with the US taking “long-term ownership” of the enclave. Trump stirred up storms of criticism for bigging upGaza’s real estate potential, suggesting he could redevelop it into a “Middle Eastern Riviera.” It’s not the first time those in Trump’s orbit floated that idea. Last year, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who served as a senior adviser to Trump in his first term, suggested “cleaning up” Gaza by booting out civilians to unlock the “very valuable” waterfront potential of the territory. Israeli Prime Minister BenjaminNetanyahu backed Trump’s “remarkable idea”during a visit to the US last week.  In recent months Israel has seen a wave offar-right settler groupsplanning and advocating for the redevelopment of Gaza, calling for Arab people to leave and to re-establish Jewish settlements. Any such land grab from the Palestinians would be illegal under international law, and likely to spark further global condemnation. Already, like France, the international community has come out vocally against Trump’s plans. The United Nations was robust, its secretary-generalwarning Trumpagainst “ethnic cleansing.” Spain’s foreign minister told radio station RNE that “Gazans’ land is Gaza.” In Western Europe, only Dutch far-right figurehead Geert Wilders broke ranks to endorse the plan. “Let Palestinians move to Jordan. Gaza-problem solved!” he wrote on X. German President Walter Steinmeier said the suggestion was “unacceptable,” and the country’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said it would “lead to new suffering and new hatred.” But some allies have tried to play both sides, keeping Trump happy while trying to uphold longheld norms overPalestinian rights. “On the issue of Gaza, Donald Trump is right,” UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy told reporters in Ukraine this week. “Looking at those scenes, Palestinians who have been horrendously displaced over so many months of war, it is clear that Gaza is lying in rubble.” Lammy went on to add: “We have always been clear in our view that we must see two states and we must see Palestinians able to live and prosper in their homelands in Gaza.” His boss, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, also stressed that Palestinians must be allowed back to their homes in Gaza. France has been full-throated in shooting down plans to displace Palestinians, with the government’s spokesperson describing such a move as a “destabilizing question in the Middle East.” With additional reporting from CNN’s Rob Picheta\n",
            "As we all live more of our lives online, it’s important to understand who might have access to our conversations and internet searches – and to understand how to maintain privacy in an increasingly connected world. In the days since billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency associates haveblazed through various government agencies, journalists have encouraged federal government workers to contact them through end-to-end encrypted platforms, like the messaging app Signal. Signal is one of a number of relativelysimple toolsthat can be used not only to help keep secure conversations with reporters, but also for communicating with colleagues when not discussing work projects, researching legal resources or even chatting with friends. It’s safe to assume that anything you do on a work computer or phone could be visible to  your employer, because they have the right to monitor usage of devices they own. “You want to think about who has access to the communications that you’re making if you’re worried that someone might try to retaliate you for having these discussions,” said Daniel Khan Gillmor, a senior staff technologist for the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. With that in mind, it’s a good idea to use a personal device for personal conversations and Google searches. The same goes for using an employer’s Wi-Fi network, on which they may be able to connect the dots between employee communications. Save any griping about work for your home network or your personal phone plan. On work Wi-Fi, “they won’t necessarily see what tea you’re spilling, but they will see who you’re spilling it to,” Gillmor said. There are a number of tech platforms that advertise encryption services for privacy — including iMessage and WhatsApp — but data security experts largely agree thatSignalis the gold standard. Signal looks like a regular messaging app for texting and making phone calls. But it’s owned by a non-profit, not a private company, and the app is end-to-end encrypted by default. That means that the content of a conversation is scrambled when it’s traveling between the sender and receiver, so no one except the parties to the conversation can see it. “If you show up with a warrant or a subpoena (to Signal), they have almost nothing about you that they can hand over,” said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. On non-encrypted messaging apps, an employer or law enforcement could potentially force a platform to hand over a user’s conversations via subpoena. End-to-end encryption itself isn’t unique among messaging apps, but certain apps that offer encryption, like WhatsApp, may still have access to non-encrypted contacts and other accounts you’ve messaged, whereas Signal’s builders can’t see that information, according to Gillmor. And whether you use Signal or WhatsApp, experts advise turning on the “disappearing messages” feature that allows users to auto-delete conversations after a set period of time — hours, or days, depending on what a user selects — so that the conversations might not be accessible even if someone else got their hands on a user’s phone. Many people are familiar with VPNs, or virtual private networks, which act kind of like a tunnel between your device and the internet that can mask where your internet traffic is coming from. VPNs can be a more private way of accessing the internet, but nevertheless, the VPN company could, in theory, be forced to hand over the information it has about your internet traffic. “When you use a VPN, the VPN company can see all your traffic, they see where you’re coming from and where you’re going. So, if somebody on the other end of the transaction sees an IP address that belongs to a VPN company, they can submit a subpoena to the VPN company,” Galperin said. The most secure option, security experts say, is to use Tor browser. It’s a browser that users can download just like Firefox or Safari, but that distributes internet traffic across a global network of different “nodes,” or computers, so that any one user’s traffic could not be accessed from a single access point. With Tor, the websites a user visits are also blocked from viewing that user’s IP address, which could allow them to be identified. If you’ve used Tor and “someone later sends a warrant to Google asking for all the searches that have been made from your home computer or your logged-in Google browser, they won’t see searches for ‘good journalist to leak to,’” Galperin said. Many news organizations also haveSecureDropfolders, allowing users to share encrypted documents and communications anonymously when using Tor. Some companies have taken aggressive measures to identify employees who leak information, such as watermarking or tweaking emails so that different employees receive slightly different versions of the same message. For that reason, security experts encourage people to be cautious about sending exact copies or photos of emails or documents. And any documents printed out could include “printer dots,” invisible tracking codes that can indicate the time, date and location where something was printed. And keep in mind that violating a non-disclosure agreement or sharing confidential information could expose you to legal risk if you are identified. Still, Gillmor said it can be a good idea to identify private channels of communication with colleagues or friends. “Protecting our rights is a team sport,” Gillmor said. “Taking the time to figure out how to do some of these things and helping your friends figure out how to do these things, even if you never end up using them in more drastic ways … is still a positive thing.”\n",
            "A war between a TikTok influencer and Italian ski resorts has escalated after she urged her two million followers to “invade” one destination because she was blamed for causing chaos at another. Buses packed with daytrippers were stopped by police before they could leave Naples on Sunday in answer to the call from Rita De Crescenzo — a TikTok star whose strong Neapolitan accent and outlandish appearance have endeared her to legions of local social media fans. The crowds had been headed to Ovindoli, a small ski town in central Italy, when they were intercepted in an attempt to prevent a repeat of scenes two weeks ago when the nearby resort of Roccaraso was inundated by 10,000 visitors inspired by online posts from De Crescenzo. Skiers, many of whom were not accustomed to the rules of the piste, were accused of leaving mountains of garbage in Roccaraso, barbecuing on the slopes, and making it difficult for regular skiers who have season passes to access the chair lifts. De Crescenzo rejected accusations that she was to blame for the chaos in Roccaraso, telling her followers, who increased by 100,000 after the first incident, that she should get paid for giving the resorts free publicity. She then told them to head to Ovindoli. Capitalizing on the call, several Neapolitan tourism agencies offered tickets to the hills for around $20 including lunch and ski passes. Others, apparently, just provided the transport. Trouble was avoided, however, after police stepped in following warnings from the mayors of Roccaraso and Ovindoli that buses would be turned away, according to authorities in Naples. Neapolitan police said they stopped several buses that were not authorized to enter either of the ski resorts. Two were stopped because of the absence of booked tickets for the resort, meaning no one onboard had ski passes, a spokesperson with the Neapolitan police told CNN. Warm temperatures that melted most of the snow on lower elevations also helped stymie what was set up to be another weekend of TikTok trouble in the mountains. Angelo Ciminelli, the mayor of Ovindoli, said after what happened in Roccaraso two weeks ago, he pre-empted the onslaught. “We had thought about adopting these measures before the challenge,” he said. “But we had no choice after she challenged her followers to come here.” The ski areas, in central Italy’s Abruzzo region, have always been popular alternatives to traveling north to the Alps or Dolomites, but Angelo Caruso, head of the province, says they had never envisioned that social media would have such an impact. Caruso ordered hundreds of law enforcement officers and called on the Italian army for backup to stand guard at various checkpoints approaching the mountain to turn anyone away who hadn’t reserved a ski pass, hotel or who lived there. The TikTok trend, he says, is luring “hordes” of people who have no real interest in skiing but want to post their own version of the experience on their social channels, which often ruins the experience for ski enthusiasts. Rita De Crescenzo’s TikTok fame has also inspired a slew of other Neapolitans to try their hand as influencers. This has also caught the attention of Italy’s Guardia di Finanza (financial police), which says it is investigating a number of the tourism agencies who allegedly sold passes and bus tickets without reporting profits to tax authorities. Influencers are also being investigated to see if they also earned a cut without reporting earnings.\n",
            "Shattered glass and a broken door covered with police tape mark the entrance to the apartment where the reported suspect in Sweden’sworst mass shootingis believed to have lived as a recluse. Citing police sources, the Swedish national broadcaster and multiple media outlets, including Reuters, have named Rickard Andersson, 35, as the man who opened fire, killing 10 people and himself, at an adulteducation centerin Örebro, Sweden. Sweden’s national broadcaster and several other media outlets published his image. When asked whether police have found any of Andersson’s family members, Chief Investigator Anna Bergqvist told CNN: “We don’t have identification yet. It will take a couple of hours or days before we have that but, of course, we have spoken to his relatives.” Police said the attacker was not known to them, he was not connected to any gangs and he was not believed to be acting based on ideological motives. PJ Samuelsson has lived next door to Andersson since May last year but said he has never seen or even heard his neighbor. He said he was in a state of shock after returning home Tuesday and finding his quiet apartment block surrounded by heavily armed police. “I couldn’t come up here. They said you’ll have to wait a couple of hours,” Samuelsson told CNN in an interview at his home Thursday. He said he knew “nothing at all” about Andersson. “I’ve only seen his name on the door, that’s the only thing,” he said, describing it as “very unusual” because he says hello daily to his other neighbors in the small block. He said he doesn’t know why his neighbor acted like a recluse but knowing he is the suspect is “terrible.” It’s a “disgusting” thought that he had weapons next door, he said. A second neighbor CNN spoke to said she had never seen Andersson and she goes in and out of the building a lot. She said she finds it “weird” she has never seen him. Andersson’s name and social security number matched the address that was held on record by the Swedish tax agency. The agency told CNN that as of 2023, its current data, it has no record of “any income from work” for Andersson since 2015. Bergqvist told a news conference Thursday: “We have a perpetrator who was found inside the school and he was not known to us from before. “He has a gun license for four guns and all these four guns have been confiscated. Three of those weapons were next to him when police secured him inside the building.” Bergqvist added, “There is information that he is somehow connected to the school, that he may have attended this school before. But that is also something that we need to look deeper into to be able to fully confirm.” She said the 10 victims of the killing have “different nationalities, different ages and different sex” and that no motive has been confirmed yet. Wednesday night, grief and shock were heavy in the air as a steady stream of mourners came to pay their respects at a candlelight vigil by the side of a busy road, next to a small housing estate and opposite the school where Tuesday’s events unfolded. A dozen firefighters were among the crowd, standing in silence, their heads bowed. “They came here to learn, not to die,” said Jenny Samuelsson, whose sister-in-law died in the shooting. She learned the news 24 hours after her sister-in-law, Camille, was killed, she said. Camille was studying to become a nurse, according to Samuelsson. “They were here to help others, to learn. I have no words,” she said, choking on her emotion. “I can’t explain the hole I have in my heart. And why? There is no answer, so what question can I even ask?” Hundreds of candles flickered in the cold night air. The young and the old arrived clutching white candles, ready to light them, along with flowers and handwritten notes paying tribute to those killed in Tuesday’s massacre. “You are in our hearts, rest in peace,” said one, written in Swedish. Another note, in English, had John Donne’s poem “No Man Is An Island.” Two 17-year-old boys, friends from primary school, stood arm in arm after bumping into each other at the vigil. They spoke of their shock over what happened and how they were forced to lock down in their high schools as the events played out. They came to show their support, they said. The emotion was palpable. School shootings are rare in Sweden and there is real shock that the peace of this small Swedish city has been so violently shattered.\n",
            "The family home where rock bandAC/DCwas founded has been mistakenly demolished by a property developer inAustralia. Located in the Sydney suburb of Burwood, 4 Burleigh Street had long been a place visited by the band’s fans from around the world. AC/DC’s Malcolm and Angus Young lived in the house as teenagers when they were founding the band, along with their brother George Young, a guitarist for another wildly popular rock group, the Easybeats. The family migrated to Australia from Scotland, living first in a migrant hostel before moving to Burleigh Street in 1965. When the Easybeats made it big, a mini riot once reportedly unfolded outside the house when a fan magazine disclosed the address. Hundreds of girls from local high schools descended upon the house and twenty forced their way inside – trampling a young Angus on their way, according to the home’s listing on Australia’s National Trust Register. The one-story, two-bedroom brick house was bought by a property developer in March 2023 for 5.8 million Australian dollars ($3.6 million). It demolished the building last month, according to CNN affiliateNine News. The developer, Burwood Square, told Nine News that it didn’t know about the cultural importance of the home, despite conducting due diligence on the site. “Unfortunately the historical connection to AC/DC was not identified, and we regret the previous long-term owner did not share this vital part of the property’s background with us,” said Leon Kamita, the company’s general manager. “Learning about this connection after our plans were already underway has shocked us,” he said in a statement. The developers plan to turn the lot into a 144 meter (472 foot)50-story tower with 120 hotel rooms and 48 affordable housing apartments, according to Nine News. The suburban home, a bungalow built in the “Federation style” that was mass produced in the early 20thcentury, had been in “poor condition” since the Young family left it in 1978, according to a review published by the Burwood Council. In 1985, it became a brothel – with local newspapers promoting “Adult Work Opportunities” at the address, according to the council. It later served as a medical practice and was being rented out to an unspecified tenant at the time of the developer’s purchase. An article published in the Sydney Morning Herald back in 2003 argued for the building to be protected from the hands of developers. “There is however, one domicile begging for immediate acquisition and deification; a small, simple dwelling at 4 Burleigh Street,” wrote rock historian Glenn A. Baker. Although the house was listed on the Australian National Trust Register in 2013, it did not receive historical protection to prevent its demolition. Burwood Council conducted a review in 2015 to determine whether it should be listed as a heritage site. Ultimately, it did not recommend a heritage listing, citing among its reasons that the band’s “period of habitation was too brief to be relevant to the life and work of AC/DC.” The review also said the home “does not meet the criteria for aesthetic significance,” nor did it have “any known technical or research value.” In a statement sent to CNN, the council said “it has long-maintained that the Young House … has a special association with Australia’s rock music history as the site where band AC/DC formed.” Despite not recommending the heritage listing, the council said it continues to undertake initiatives to celebrate the band’s legacy, including the commissioning of a mural near the site. In its statement to Nine News, Burwood Square said it is “dedicated” to celebrating the location and is salvaging materials from the demolition to create a special space where fans can gather to celebrate the band’s legacy. CNN has reached out to representatives of AC/DC for comment.\n",
            "A couple who bought a London mansion for £32,500,000 ($40,200,000)have been told by a court that they can hand the property back and recoup most of their costs after the house was found to have a huge moth infestation. Situated on one of the quiet leafy streets just outside Notting Hill, Horbury Villa seemed like the perfect northwest London home. But behind its grand Victorian façade, a colony of moths living in the insulation wreaked havoc across the house, which contains a pool, spa, gym, cinema and wine room. Iya Patarkatsishvili, the daughter of a Georgian billionaire, and her husband Yevhen Hunyak bought the house in May 2019 from William Woodward-Fisher, a surveyor and residential real estate developer, according to thejudgmentpublished Monday. However, the couple said that once they moved in they found moths on their toothbrushes, towels and wine glasses. The insects also caused damage to their clothes, some of which were thrown away. At one point, Hunyak said he would kill between 10 and 35 moths every day, while his family and cleaners did the same. A judge has found in the couple’s favor, ruling that Woodward-Fisher made “fraudulent misrepresentations” and “concealed a serious clothes moth infestation of the insulation in the house” before the sale, according to apress summaryof the judgment, published Monday. Mr Justice Fancourt ruled that Woodward-Fisher had falsely answered three queries before selling the house, including by saying that he didn’t know of any vermin infestation or of any hidden defect in the property. According to the judgment, Woodward-Fisher’s wife had noticed a problem with clothes moths (Tineola Bisselliella) in early 2018 after new insulation was installed as part of major building works. The help of extermination specialists was enlisted to deal with the problem. She then forwarded some of these emails about the infestation to her husband Woodward-Fisher, the judgment said. Fancourt noted in his judgment that he didn’t think Woodward-Fisher was “consciously trying to deceive the Claimants. He simply wanted to sell the house and move on.” As well as granting Patarkatsishvili and Hunyak most of their money back, minus an amount to take into account the period they lived there, Fancourt also awarded them “substantial damages” and all the costs they incurred trying to get rid of the moths.\n",
            "Plastic tubes meander from Rosella’s nose to a nearby oxygen tank that’s bigger than she is, as she flicks through a book of her drawings: a flower, a house, a chicken. The 9-year-old needs non-stop medical attention for the bone condition she was born with that has left her ribs pushing dangerously on her lungs, one of which is not working as it should. “She cannot breathe properly,” her mother, Rebecca, 27, tells CNN via video call. “She needs a constant supply of oxygen.” But she doesn’t know how long it will last. Rosella and her mother are refugees living in one of nine remote camps dotted alongThailand’smountainous border with Myanmar. About 100,000 people live in the camps, having fled decades of fighting between the Myanmar military and ethnic minority rebel groups. The situation at the border has worsened in recent years by the junta’s coup andensuing civil war. Mae La is the biggest camp and its US-funded hospital is the only source of health care for more than 37,000 people living there – mostly from the ethnic Karen minority. When the Trump administration ordered a90-day freezeon almost all international aid, halting the US’ entireglobal development networkovernight, the camp hospital was forced to shut its doors, sending shock waves through the refugee community. Video posted by refugees on social media showed patients at the center being lifted from their hospital beds and carried out in hammocks covered in blankets. Rosella was moved to a nearby improvised health center, along with other patients with chronic conditions. But there are no longer any doctors to treat her. Numerous aid workers in northern Thailand described widespread panic and confusion following the sudden suspension of aid, especially among those whose work provides life-saving services to some of the world’s most vulnerable and impoverished people on both sides of the border. Some told CNN they only had a month and a half of funding left to feed tens of thousands of people. “We have never faced a problem like this before,” said Saw Bweh Say, secretary of the Karen Refugee Committee, which represents refugees in the Thai camps. Refugees in the Thai border camps live a fragile and isolated existence. They cannot legally work and need a permit to even leave the camp. The Thai government considers the camps temporary settlements, but some communities have been there for generations. Basic services such as health care, education, sanitation, water and food are provided by international aid donors. In Mae La, and six other camps, those funds come almost entirely from the US – the world’s largest aid donor – through the International Rescue Committee. Though the camp hospitals are more akin to field clinics, with tin roofs and intermittent power, they are the only source of health care for tens of thousands of people. “If it’s an emergency, how can we face the situation? That burdens a lot of people here,” said Ni Ni, 62, who has heart failure and kidney disease. Without medical oxygen, “I will die,” she told CNN via video call from Mae La. For some, it’s already too late. In nearby Umpiem camp, an elderly lady with breathing problems died after she could not access supplemental oxygen due to the hospital closure, an IRC spokesperson said. Other refugees told CNN they now face the cost for treatments such as dialysis – a huge expense when most struggle to feed their families. An IRC spokesperson said they had to start shutting outpatient departments and other facilities in the camps following the stop-work order. Management of the medical facilities, equipment and water system has been transferred to Thai authorities and camp commanders, though the IRC continues to source medicine and fuel using non-US funds. Teams of refugee medics, midwives and nurses are working round-the-clock helping to plug the gaps, while families scramble for alternative treatment for their loved ones. “Karen families donated medicine and oxygen tanks, but that’s not enough,” said Pim Kerdsawang, an independent NGO worker in the border city of Mae Sot. Compounding their concerns is the cost of food. Feeding more than 100,000 refugees across all nine camps for one month costs $1.3 million dollars, and the organization that provides the food and cooking fuel says it has only enough money to last for a month and a half. Refugees use a food card system to buy items in the camp shops, which is paid for by The Border Consortium. The food and cooking fuel are funded by State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM), the group said. “The main concern is not having the means to provide the refugees with food and cooking fuel. So far, there is no alternative to the US grant,” said Leon de Riedmatten, executive director ofThe Border Consortium. The organization has started prioritizing the most vulnerable refugees who have no income of their own, Riedmatten said, as the aid freeze and continuous arrival of new refugees fleeing violence in Myanmar drains the funds. When Tawatchai Yingtaweesak heard the camp hospitals had shut, his team raced to see how they could help. Tawatchai is director of the Tha Song Yang hospital, about a 30-minute drive from sprawling Mae La. With no doctors on duty in the camps, his hospital and several others have stepped in to treat refugees with serious and emergency conditions. Tawatchai said suddenly closing the US-funded hospital was “dangerous” and, since the aid freeze, his facility has taken in between 20 and 30 refugee patients. He is working with camp medics and helping to deliver oxygen, among other supplies, but says this can only be a temporary fix. His hospital serves about 100,000 people and while they can cope, he worries that this year’s rainy season will overwhelm them. Typically starting around June, the monsoon is “high season for disease,” Tawatchai said, with a surge in mosquito-borne diseases and children with pneumonia. Naw Mary, 32, was rushed to the maternity ward at Tha Song Yang on Sunday, suffering from high blood pressure. Far from her family and home at the camp, she was about to give birth to her first child. “They said it was risky to deliver a child in the camp without a doctor and facilities so they referred me to this hospital,” Naw Mary said. Nervous and excited to bring her baby into the world, Naw Mary also said she’s concerned about follow-up care for her newborn and herself. “Why did they have to stop helping the refugees?” she asked. The pain created by the US aid freeze goes beyond the refugee camps. CNN spoke to about a dozen NGO and aid workers in the impoverished border region, some of whom requested anonymity as they feared reprisals from the US government, who said basic services were disrupted and staff laid off due to the Trump administration’s policy. They include cuts to vaccine, education and resettlement programs, domestic violence shelters, anti-human-trafficking initiatives, safe houses for dissidents, and help for displaced people. For more than 30 years, the Mae Tao clinic near Mae Sot has been a lifeline for vulnerable and impoverished migrants from Myanmar. The clinic handles almost 500 patients a day, and 20% of its funding comes from the US. Now that funding has been put on hold, the clinic has to reallocate part of its budget so their health care services are not impacted. “This fund we only use for vulnerable people and those who are really in need,” said Saw Than Lwin, deputy director of organization and development at Mae Tao. Nearby the clinic, aid workers with the Burma Children Medical Fund load boxes of supplies containing food, infant formula baby milk powder, medicine, and eye screening kits, into a van. It’s headed across the Moei River, a border between Thailand and Myanmar, to help thousands of people just kilometers away displaced by Myanmar military airstrikes and ground attacks. The needs in Myanmar are huge, aid workers say, where millions of people struggle with hunger, trauma and the constant threat of attacks. “The places that we’re working in are the remotest areas in all of Burma, very hard to reach communities without other alternatives to medical assistance,” said Salai Za Uk Ling, founder of the Chin Human Rights Organization. About 30% of CHRO’s funding comes from the USAID and the group, which provides medical and mental health care to tens of thousands of people in Myanmar’s northwest, has had to cut vital services and lay off staff in the past three weeks. “Rural communities, people who are living in displaced situation, don’t know a whole lot about international politics, all they care about is their daily survival,” Za Uk said. “How do we even begin to explain to them why this is happening?” In Myanmar’s Kayah state, also known as Karenni, the aid suspension has meant teachers’ salaries cannot be paid, leaving kids without education, said Banya Khung Aung, founder and director of the Karenni Human Rights Group. If they had more notice, groups like his could have sourced alternative funding, he said. US Secretary of State Marco Rubiohas claimedthe US is continuing to provide lifesaving humanitarian aid. Rubio, now theacting administrator of USAID, reiterated last week that he had issued a blanket waiver for lifesaving programs. “If it’s providing food or medicine or anything that is saving lives and is immediate and urgent, you’re not included in the freeze. I don’t know how much more clear we can be than that,” Rubio said, questioning the competency of organizations that haven’t applied for a waiver. At least six organizations that CNN spoke to in northern Thailand said they had not received waivers, or even been reviewed. And USAID employeestold CNNalmost all humanitarian assistance programs remain stopped. “A week or two ago people thought the waiver process would be legitimate, and programs would be reviewed,” one USAID employee based in Washington, DC, told CNN. “When it became clear that was not happening, there was a complete sense of shock.” Another USAID employeetold CNN“work is grounded to a halt because there’s no staff to manage it, and there’s no staff in DC to answer questions from partners.” Even if funds are made available after the 90-day freeze, “who would then communicate to us or be knowledgeable enough to process what is left of the system?” asked Za Uk from CHRO. “By time that any funding reaches us, unfortunately for those suffering from serious medical condition might be lost.” In his January 20 executive order, President Donald Trumpsaidthe “US foreign aid industry” serves to “destabilize world peace” and is “in many cases antithetical to American values.” But those affected in northern Thailand are some of the world’s most vulnerable people who rely on US aid to survive. In Mae La camp, Rosella can’t stray far from her oxygen tank. She needs one tank every two days, her mother said. Complicating their family’s situation is that Rebecca is five months pregnant. She used to get her ultrasounds and prenatal care at the hospital, but that has all stopped as well. “I don’t know what to do. There are no doctors to go and see right now for this pregnancy,” she said. “I’m worried for my daughter and this pregnancy, worried for everyone.”\n",
            "American skierMikaela Shiffrinwon a record-tying 15thworld championshipsmedal by taking gold in the inaugural women’s team combined event alongside Breezy Johnson. The duo finished with a combined time of 2:40.89 in Saalbach, Austria – Shiffrin having competed in the slalom and Johnson in the downhill. It was the 29-year-old Johnson’s second gold medal of the world championships having claimed the individual downhill title on Saturday. Shiffrin, meanwhile, announced on Monday that she waswithdrawing from this week’s giant slalom race, citing PTSD from her serious crash in Killington, Vermont on November 30. The two-time Olympic champion posted the third-fastest time in the slalom during Tuesday’s team combined event, and her victory alongside Johnson matches the overall world championships record set by German skier Christl Cranz in the 1930s. “This was an amazing day,”saidShiffrin about teaming up with her childhood friend. “For me up there, it was nerve-wracking because Breezy did her job just spectacularly this morning, it was so much fun to watch. All these days, day in and day out, she’s been executing.” Chasing a record-extending 100th World Cup win of her career, Shiffrin suffered a puncture wound to her abdomen and severe muscle trauma when shecrashed out in the giant slalom event in Killington. On Monday, she said that she is still “working through some mental obstacles” before returning to the giant slalom, which she called “an event that I loved so dearly only 2 months ago.” The team combined race, a new addition to this year’s world championships, sees one skier compete in the downhill and another in the slalom, with their scores added together in the final leaderboard. The Swiss team of Lara Gut-Behrami and Wendy Holdener won silver, 0.39 seconds behind Shiffrin and Johnson, while Stephanie Venier and Katharina Truppe of Austria were 0.53 seconds back in third. American Lauren Macuga was the fastest in the downhill, but she and teammate Paula Moltzan eventually finished fourth overall, narrowly missing out on a medal. Lindsey Vonn, meanwhile, was 21st in the downhill and 16th overall with US teammate AJ Hurt. Prior to the event, Vonn had deleted a social media post bemoaning that fact that she wasn’t paired with Shiffrin, which would have united the two most decorated female skiers in World Cup history. “Maybe I didn’t help myself or the team by having my Twitter fingers out,” the 40-year-old Vonn, who recently came out of retirement and returned to competitive skiing, said on Tuesday, perThe Associated Press (AP). “But at the same time, I’m a human being and I was disappointed in the communication. And I let my feelings be known. I’m a human. I have feelings. So shoot me.” According to AP, American speed coach Alex Hödlmoser explained the decision to pair Shiffrin with Johnson, saying: “It would have been a cool thing if those two greats (Shiffrin and Vonn) would have raced together, but at the moment, others are stronger in their performance. “We had to make sure to bring the fastest pairings together, and it was very obvious that Breezy was the fastest in the downhill and therefore would race with Mikaela.”\n",
            "Marwan Ouarab is an unlikely hero. The convicted con artist, once almost sent to prison for selling fake concert tickets, has found a new calling: saving scam victims from their online predators. For many, he’s their last hope of recovering stolen savings or cherished treasures. “It’s the path to redemption that I’ve chosen,” Ouarab told CNN with a smile. The 29-year-old founder of FindMyScammer.com – a company created in 2023 that investigates online scammers – has been thrust into the global spotlight in recent weeks after one of his clients’ stories went viral. Anne - who asked that only her first name be used for privacy reasons – is a 53-year-old French woman who was swindled out of €830,000 ($860,000) by fraudsters who convinced her she was dating Hollywood actor Brad Pitt for over a year and a half. The criminals bombarded her with fake photos and deepfake videos purportedly showing the real actor talking to Anne and asking her for money. The videos sent to Anne are slick and – at least at first glance – look convincing, only betrayed by the sometimes-bizarre audio and unnatural eye movements of the AI-generated fake. Contacted by TF1, a French broadcaster that was reporting on Anne’s story, Ouarab used open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques to track down her scammers in Nigeria. To track down those accused of defrauding Anne, Ouarab relied on a tried-and-true tactic: taking advantage of the alleged scammers’ greediness by sending them a booby-trapped link disguised as a legitimate banking platform. “Basically, (OSINT) is the art of finding a person using very little information,” explained Ouarab. With just a phone number or an e-mail address, the 29-year-old can unmask online scammers, finding their real name, age, and location. “To collect their data, I just had to wait for them to click on the link, and give me their consent,” Ouarab explained. This method ensures that the data obtained can be lawfully passed to the police. It’s not only reformed scammers who can master these tricks. “Anyone can use these tools,” he emphasized. “It’s really basic-level OSINT I used for this case.” Ouarab was then able to access the alleged scammers’ IP address, geolocate them to a house in Nigeria, and identify three young men in their twenties living there. He compiled all these details into a report, which Anne submitted to the police when she filed a complaint, her former lawyer Laurène Hanna told CNN. French authorities have since launched an investigation, and Ouarab’s report is being used as a piece of evidence, the Réunion prosecutor’s office told CNN. No one has yet been charged in the case. While Anne’s story seems extraordinary, for Ouarab and the FindMyScammer team, it’s sadly all too common. In 2024 alone, consumers lost more than $1 trillion to scams globally, according to an international survey by the Global Anti-Scam Alliance. With the French government’s international AI Action Summit taking place in Paris this week, the rise of sophisticated deepfakes and the urgent need for better detection methods are expected to be on the agenda. French President Emmanuel Macron says he is personally committed to ensuring the summit’s success and numerous world leaders are participating, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, China’s Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing and US Vice President JD Vance. Falling prey to an online scam doesn’t require sophisticated AI-generated videos and deepfakes. “Anyone can fall victim to these scams,” warned Ouarab. He speaks from personal experience: A few years ago, he says his aunt lost 80,000 euros’ ($82,880) worth of Cartier jewellery while trying to sell it on Leboncoin.fr, a French online marketplace. Desperate, she asked Ouarab if he could help track down the scammers. “I learned all my skills on the dark side. I realized they could also be put to good use,” he recalled. Ouarab says he managed to track down the swindler and scare him into returning the stolen jewellery to his aunt. Until only six years ago, Ouarab himself was the one scamming people. He would sell fake concert tickets by printing out working barcodes onto blank tickets that he stole from his local shop. The scam worked for a while, but the police eventually caught on. At the age of 25, he was convicted of fraud, handed a 10-month suspended prison sentence, and ordered to pay 11,000 euros in compensation to the victims. He decided to turn his life around and, in 2023, officially launched FindMyScammer.com, which he claims is the first company devoted to tracking down online scammers, although other companies such as Forward Global offer a similar service in the United States. What began as a one-man operation has grown into a thriving 14-person business. It’s a success that is set to continue as online scams figures soar. In the United States alone, reported losses tied to so-called “pig butchering” scams – a blend of “romance” and financial investment fraud – skyrocketed from $907 million in 2020 to a staggering $2.9 billion by November 2023, according to the FBI. “Over time, the number of victims will only keep rising,” said Ouarab, who says his company receives between 100 and 150 new scam-related requests for help every day. The consequences of online scams can be devastating, leaving some victims with drained life savings, shattered families, or, in some cases, driving them to suicide. Matters are often made worse when authorities refuse to investigate. “In many cases, the police rejected my clients’ complaints, citing insufficient evidence,” the lawyer Hanna told CNN. Luca, who does not wish to use his real name for safety reasons, is a former client of Ouarab, and shared a similar story with CNN. He lost 67,000 euros ($69,500) in a “pig butchering” scam and felt powerless when he said French law enforcement declined to investigate. “I was totally helpless. When I went to the police to file a complaint, they made me understand that there was nothing they could do for me,” Luca said. In 2022, Luca met “Zara” on Tinder, and the two quickly began an online relationship, sending text messages and making video calls. They never met in person, as “Zara” claimed to work in finance in London and Luca was in Paris. Four months into their relationship, she told him she was making money investing on a crypto-investment platform and suggested he give it a try. Luca first invested 10,000 euros ($10,400) and seemed to double his earnings. He then invested 40,000 euros and, after two months, his virtual wallet was worth 100,000 euros. When he wanted to withdraw some of his money, he was asked to pay 17,000 euros ($17,700), he said. “Zara” assured him that this was a normal procedure for paying taxes on profits made. Luca paid; he never saw any of the money or “Zara” again. For a fee of 2,500 euros ($2,600), Ouarab identified “Zara,” Luca’s accused scammer, and traced her to Dubai, where she is allegedly part of a larger fraud ring, according to Ouarab. With this information, Luca was able to demand his bank reimburse nearly half of his losses and prompted an official investigation into his case. Banks have certain obligations to clients. According to Louis Audibert, director of the investigation and dispute department at Forward Global, “if you transfer money to someone, the bank has to make sure that the name of the bank account holder matches the number of the bank account.” In Anne’s case, he said, this means that they had an obligation “to verify that the bank account was really held by Brad Pitt.” They also have an obligation of prevention. “If I, as someone who earns a salary in France, start wiring large amounts of money abroad, the bank should flag those transactions because they are irregular,” said Audibert. While not every case will result in a success story, FindMyScammer.com investigates a wide range of scams. From “romance” scams and “pig butchering” to blackmail over intimate photos and financial fraud, the work of the company now extends beyond individual clients. Corporations are hiring Ouarab and his team to test their security by attempting to defraud them. Even governments and public institutions, such as the French governmental center for child welfare, collaborate with FindMyScammer.com to combat underage prostitution networks, he said. “We work to identify the leaders of these prostitution networks. It’s been highly effective,” said Ouarab, visibly proud of his company’s broader impact. Tracking down crooks comes with its own risks. Ouarab and his team have received numerous threats, which is why the identities of all employees, except Ouarab’s, are kept secret. He himself takes care to conceal where he lives, having been forced to move several times because of safety concerns. “I have to be very careful, but I know it’s for a good cause,” he said. “I’ve been a crook before, and I deeply regret it. “If this is the price I have to pay to redeem myself, then so be it.”\n",
            "A traffic accident involving a bus in southern Mexico, which took place in the early hours of Saturday morning, killed 41 people, the government of Tabasco state said in a statement, adding that recovery work was still ongoing. The bus, which was carrying 48 people, collided with a truck, resulting in the deaths of 38 passengers and two of the drivers, the local authorities said, adding that the driver of the truck also died. Reuters images show the bus completely burned out after it was engulfed by flames following the collision, with just the skeletal remains of the metal frame left standing. “So far, only 18 skulls have been confirmed, but much more is missing,” sources for the security of Tabasco said on condition of anonymity, adding that recovery work continued. Bus operator Tours Acosta said it was “profoundly sorry about what happened,” in a post on Facebook, adding that it was working with authorities to find out what happened and if the bus had been traveling within the speed limit.\n",
            "India’sreligious minorities have faced a “staggering” rise in hate speech over the past year, including from top leaders of the ruling Hindu nationalist party of Prime MinisterNarendra Modi, according to a report released Monday. The number of hate speech incidents targeting Muslim and Christian minorities rose to 1,165 in 2024 from 668 the year prior, a 74% increase, according to a report from the Washington-based research group, India Hate Lab. The majority of these, around 98%, targeted Muslims, either explicitly or alongside Christians. “Hate speech in India in 2024 followed an alarming trajectory, deeply intertwined with the ideological ambitions of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the broader Hindu nationalist movement,” the report said. Modi, whowon a third termin last year’s elections, has long been accused by critics of fueling religious tensions and inciting violence against Muslims and other minorities since assuming power more than a decade ago. His Hindu nationalist party has sought to turn India – a nation constitutionally bound to secularism – into a Hindu rashtra, or homeland for the Hindu majority, critics say, at the expense of the millions who profess minority faiths. Modi and his BJP have repeatedly said they do not discriminate against minority groups. The BJP’s national spokesperson, Jaiveer Shergill, condemned the report on Monday, saying it was published to malign India’s image. “India as a nation has a very strong legal system which is structured to maintain peace, order and ensure non-violence at any cost,” Shergill told CNN. “Today’s India does not need any certification from any ‘anti-India reports industry’ which is run by vested interests to prejudice and dent India’s image.” According to the report, hate speech last year reinforced “longstanding Hindu nationalist tropes” such as the portrayal of Muslims and Christians as “outsiders,” “foreigners” and “invaders” who lack a legitimate claim to belonging in India, the report said. It found that the BJP organized around 30% of last year’s hate speech events, a nearly six-fold increase from the year prior, with itsparty leaders delivering452 hate speeches, a 350% rise from the previous year. The majority were recorded during the general election campaign. Modi has in the pastbeen accused of making Islamophobic remarksin speeches on the campaign trail. “These high-profile hate speeches (by Modi and powerful regional leaders) were further amplified and reinforced by an arsenal of local BJP leaders, Hindu far-right organizations, and religious figures, who spread similar rhetoric at community and grassroots levels,” the report found. Muslims make up roughly 200 million of India’s 1.4 billion population, with the population of Christians at roughly 27 million. Under Modi’s leadership,Hindu nationalistshave been appointed to top positions in key government institutions, giving them the power to make sweeping changes to legislation that rights groups say unfairly target Muslims. Textbooks have been rewritten to downplay the history of India’s former Islamic rulers, cities and streets with Mughal-era names renamed and Muslim properties have been demolished by authorities forillegal encroachment on government landand as punishment for alleged rioting. In 2019, Modi removed the special autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir – India’s only Muslim-majority state – bringing it under the direct control of New Delhi. That same year, his administration passed a controversial citizenship law that excluded Muslim migrants, sparking deadly riots. India prohibits hate speech under several sections of its penal code, including a section that criminalizes “deliberate and malicious acts” intended to insult religious beliefs. However, some experts say hate speech has proliferated in India as a result of the judiciary’s reluctance to recognize hate speech offenses. Anas Tanwir, a lawyer and founder of the Indian Civil Liberties Union, said the judiciary has failed to take concrete action against hate speech “despite clear prohibitions under various laws in India.” The India Hate Lab, a project under the Washington, DC-based think tank Center for the Study of Organized Hate (CSOH), releases annual data on hate speech in the world’s largest democracy. They define hate speech by the United Nations framework which looks at any kind of communication in speech, writing or behavior that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language based on a person’s religion.

            "Back at the turn of the 21st century, Qatar was a country with few cultural attractions to keep visitors and residents entertained. Yet theSheikh Faisal Bin Qassim Al Thani Museum— known as the FBQ Museum — was a place that most people visited as an alternative to the then-still rather ramshackle National Museum of Qatar. You had to make an appointment, and drive out into the desert, getting lost a few times along the way, but then you were welcomed to the lush Al Samriya Farm with a cup of tea and some cake. The highlight was being allowed into a space crammed full with shelves and vitrines holding all sorts of eclectic artifacts from swords to coins — with the odd car and carriage standing in the grounds. It wasn’t necessarily the kind of museum you’d find elsewhere in the world, but it was definitely a sight that needed seeing. Today, it has grown and now claims to be one of the world’s largest private museums. It holds over 30,000 items, including a fleet of traditional dhow sailboats, and countless carpets. There’s also an entire house that once stood in Damascus, Syria. There are archaeological finds dating to the Jurassic age, ancient copies of the Quran, a section that details the importance of pearling within Qatar’s history, and jewelry dating to the 17th century. There are also items from 2022’s FIFA World Cup in Qatar including replica trophies, balls used in the games, entry passes, football jerseys and even shelves full of slightly creepy dolls and children’s plush animals. Some of the more disturbing exhibits include various items of Third Reich paraphernalia in the wartime room, and, strangely enough, several showcases of birds’ legs with marking rings on them. Basically, whatever you can think of, you have a very good chance of finding it here. Rumor even has it that behind a locked door is a room filled with the late Princess Diana’s dresses and other memorabilia, accessible only to a select few visitors. Another door hides a room, no longer open to the public, filled with collectibles of the late Saddam Hussein. The museum’s history starts in 1998, when Sheikh Faisal Bin Qassim Al Thani opened a building to the public on his farm some 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Qatari capital Doha. A distant relative of Qatar’s ruling family, founder and chairman of Al Faisal Holdings (one of Qatar’s biggest conglomerates), and a billionaire whose business acumen had him recognized as one of the most influential Arab businessmen in the world, Sheikh Faisal had already amassed a substantial private collection of historically important regional artifacts, plus a few quirky pieces of interest, allowing visitors an intimate look into Qatari life and history. In an interview with Qatari channel Alrayyan TV in 2018, Sheikh Faisal said that the museum started as a hobby. “I used to collect items whenever I got the chance,” he said. “As my business grew, so did my collections, and soon I was able to collect more and more items until I decided to put them in the museum for the public to enjoy.” His private cabinet of curiosities has since evolved into a 130-acre complex. Through the fort-like entrance gate lies an oryx reserve, an impressive riding school and stables, a duck pond and a mosque built with a quirky leaning minaret. There’s now even a five-starMarriott hotel, two cafes and the Zoufa restaurant serving modern Lebanese cuisine. Of course, there’s also the super-sized museum, with a recently-opened car collection housing everything from vintage Rolls-Royces to wartime Jeeps and colorful Buicks. Outside you’ll find peacocks roaming the grounds, and signs warning drivers to be aware of horses and ostriches. Visitors to the FBQ museum are free to explore the grounds and can even enter the stables to pat the horses. Siham Haleem, a private tour guide for 15 years, says that Doha now has many world-class, modern museums — the National Museum of Qatar being a firm personal favorite. And yet he says that visiting Sheikh Faisal’s museum should still be on everybody’s to-do list. “For those eager to learn about Qatar’s — and the region’s — heritage and beyond, the museum is an ideal destination,” he says. “Personally, I’m captivated by the car collection, the fossils, and especially the Syrian house, painstakingly transported and reassembled piece by piece.” Stephanie Y. Martinez, a Mexican-American student mobility manager at Texas A&M University in Qatar likes the museum so much she includes it on all of her itineraries for students visiting from the main campus in Texas. “The guided tours are very detailed, and the collections found at the museum have great variety and so many stories to unfold,” she says. “Truly, the museum has something to pique everyone’s interest. My favorites are the cars and the furniture exhibits showcasing wood and mother-of-pearl details. Definitely one of my favorite museums in Qatar, every time I visit I learn something new.” Raynor Abreu, from India, also had praise for the unusual and immense collection. “Each item has its own story, making the visit even more interesting,” he says. “It’s also impressive to know that Sheikh Faisal started collecting these unique pieces when he was very young. Knowing this makes the museum even more special, as it reflects his lifelong passion for history and culture.” It takes time and dedication to truly examine the many collections within the museum — especially since most of them are simply on display without explanation. Eclectic it may be, but it’s hard to fault the determination of Sheikh Faisal, who has brought together items that tell the story of Qatar and the Middle East. Sarah Bayley, from the UK, says she visited the museum recently with her family, including 16 and 19-year-old teenagers, and was won over by its sheer eccentricity. “Amazing. Loved it. It is a crazy place.”\n",
            "Nearly 4,000 people have signed anopen lettercalling on Christie’s New York to cancelan upcoming salededicated solely to art created with artificial intelligence (AI) — the first of its kind for a major auction house — over concerns that the programs used to create some generative digital pieces are trained on copyrighted work and exploit human artists. The online letter began circulating Saturday, the day after the Christie’s Augmented Intelligencesale was announced. The sale, which the auction house expects will bring in more than $600,000, includes work by artistsRefik Anadol,Harold Cohen, Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst, Alexander Reben and Claire Silver. The more than 20 lots in the sale span five decades, and roughly one quarter are digitally native works like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), according to Christie’s. Examples of other works in the auction include light boxes and screens, as well as sculptures, paintings and prints. Bidding is scheduled to begin February 20 and run until March 5. At publishing, the letter calling on Christie’s to halt the auction had 3,936 signatures attached. The authors largely take issue with the AI models used to create some of the works in the sale, which they say were trained on copyrighted works without their creators’ authorization. “These models, and the companies behind them, exploit human artists, using their work without permission or payment to build commercial AI products that compete with them,”the letterreads. “Your support of these models, and the people who use them, rewards and further incentivizes AI companies’ mass theft of human artists’ work.” The use of artists’ copyrighted work to train generative AI models that power programs likeMidjourney, Stable DiffusionandDall-Ehave resulted in lawsuits against the technology companies creating the software. Artists say their work has been used by the AI programs to train models without their permission or financial compensation. The technology companiesdefend themselvesby citing fair use, which allows for the use of some copyrighted material without permission in some cases. “Why are Christie’s condoning these models by helping sell these works for tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, when the models are directly leading to the impoverishment of so many artists that they’ve stolen from?” Ed Newton-Rex, the chief executive of Fairly Trained, a non-profit that certifies generative AI companies for fairer data sourcing,wrote on X. The letter is addressed to Christie’s digital art specialists Nicole Sales Giles and Sebastian Sanchez, who are heading up the auction. In a statement, a spokesperson for the auction house toldThe Art Newspaper:“The artists represented in this sale all have strong, existing multidisciplinary art practices, some recognized in leading museum collections. The works in this auction are using artificial intelligence to enhance their bodies of work.” Sarp Kerem Yavuz, an artist whose practice sometimes incorporates AI and whose work is included in the Christie’s sale (and acontributortoThe Art Newspaper), says the idea that AI-generated art is theft is based on a misunderstanding of the data sets used in such work. “Most AI-generated images result from the combination of millions — literally millions — of images, which means no single artist can claim that an image of a meadow, a heroic knight, a cat or a flower was based on their specific creation,” he wrote in a statement. “AI-generated images mimic human inspiration in many ways — they’re just more efficient at parsing through information.” As AI technology advances and becomes more integrated into day-to-day life, laws regarding copyright and fair use are struggling to keep up. Last month, the US Copyright Office ruled that artists can copyright work they created using AI tools, but that “purely AI-generated material”remains ineligiblefor protections.

            "The final NFLhead coaching vacancyhas been filled. On Tuesday, theNew Orleans SaintsnamedPhiladelphia Eaglesoffensive coordinator Kellen Moore as the franchise’s next head coach. The 36-year-old becomes theyoungesthead coach in the NFL. “I am excited to join the New Orleans Saints and deeply appreciate the faith that Mrs. Benson and the entire Saints organization have placed in me,” Moore said in a statement. “I look forward to embracing the challenges ahead and am eager to get started. I would also like to thank the Philadelphia Eagles for an incredible 2024 season. I’m excited to begin this new chapter.” Moore spent one season overseeing the Eagles’ offense where he helped Philadelphia to animpressive40-22 Super Bowl victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday at Caesars Superdome, home of the Saints. The Eagles scored 145 points during their championship run, the most in a single postseason in NFL history. Philadelphia ranked second in rushing (179.3 yards per game) and eighth in total offense (367.2 yards per game) this past season. Prior to his stint in Philly, Moore was the offensive coordinator with the Los Angeles Chargers in 2023 after spending four seasons in the same position with the Dallas Cowboys. Dallas ranked second in the NFL in total offense (391 yards per game), scoring offense (27.7 points per game) and touchdowns (210) during Moore’s tenure running the Cowboys’ offense. Moore inherits a team that finished 5-12 and was tied for last in the NFC South division. The Saints have missed the postseason for four consecutive years. In November, New Orleans fired head coach Dennis Allen after two-plus seasons in the Big Easy; special teams coordinator Darren Rizzi filled in as interim coach. The Saints currently hold the No. 9 overall selection in April’s NFL draft.\n",
            "For the Israeli hostagesfreed Saturday, the suffering did not end when Hamas militants paraded their frail and gaunt figures on a stage in Gaza ahead of their release to the Red Cross. Only later, after the freed men arrived back in Israel, would two of them discover that some of the loved ones they had hoped to see again were already dead. During their stage-managed appearance at the hands of Hamas militants, one of the Israeli hostages, Eli Sharabi, told the crowd that he hoped to see his wife Lianne and daughters Noiya and Yahel. All three were killed in Kibbutz Be’eri during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel onOctober 7– but it was only on his return to Israel that Sharabi learnt their fate, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Sharabi did appear to know, however, that his brother Yossi – who was also taken hostage by Hamas – had subsequently died in Gaza, where his body remains, according to the Israeli military. Both men and their families had lived at the kibbutz, where more than 100 people were killed during the October 7 attacks. Sharabi’s niece has previously spoken of how close the two families were. Or Levy, another of the hostages released Saturday, had suspected that his wife Einav had died but had not known for sure as he had no access to media during his time in captivity, his mother Geula Levy said. Levy, 34, was attending the Nova music festival on October 7 when he was kidnapped. His wife Einav was killed in the attack. Following his release on Saturday, Levy’s mother said he had asked about his wife while in Sheba Hospital, where he was reunited with family members. “He did not know. He assumed, and asked, and we told him,” Geula told Israel’s public broadcaster Kann 11 News. While in the hospital, Levy reunited with his son, Almog, who was only 2 years old when his father was taken hostage. The father and son came together “as if nothing had happened,” Geula said. Levy’s family issued a statement following his release, celebrating his return while also mourning the death of Einav. “Her loss has left an enormous void in all our hearts,” they said. Sharabi, Levy and Ohad Ben Ami’s treatment in captivity, compounded by the realization they did not know of their loved ones’ fate, has galvanized one family whose son was killed by Hamas last year to call on US President Donald Trump to speed up the hostage release process. On Saturday, the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an Israeli-American murdered by Hamas militants in Gaza in August, urged Trump and his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to push for the release of all hostages held in Gaza “this week,” dismissing the multi-staged approach to the ceasefire deal agreed by Israel and Hamas. “Our plea to you (Trump and Witkoff) right now is, now that you’ve done the hard part of getting movement, getting a deal started, let’s not think about phase one and phase two and phase three and many months,” Jon Goldberg-Polin said in the video. “Let’s think bigger and faster.” “All 76 hostages out this week. End of war. Who benefits from dragging it out for so long? Not the people of this region. Let’s get it done right now,” he said. The scenes from Saturday’s hostage handover have drawn condemnation from Israel, who called the men’s appearances “shocking,” with a group representing the families of hostages saying that it was “horrified by the visible physical and mental condition” of the men. Levy – who was released as he was considered a humanitarian case – appeared particularly frail. Following the handover, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a statement that it is “increasingly concerned about the conditions surrounding release operations,” and urged all parties to “ensure that future releases are dignified and private.” Later Saturday, Hamas also released a highly produced propaganda video showing the three men together inside a tunnel, in a departure from previous hostage releases. The three men were released in the fifth round of exchanges between Hamas and Israel. Later Saturday, Israel released 183 Palestinian prisoners due to be freed in the deal, 18 of whom were serving life sentences. A total of 33 Israeli hostages are expected to be released as part of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, which went into force on January 19 and is supposed to last six weeks. Following Saturday’s exchange, Hamas and its allies still hold a total of 73 people taken from Israel on October 7, 2023, and an additional three held in Gaza since before then. Negotiations on the second and third phases are not yet believed to have begun in earnest. Hersh Goldberg-Polin was kidnapped at the same time as Levy. Both had tried to hide in a bomb shelter before they were caught and taken to Gaza in the back of a pickup truck. The Goldberg-Polins said their appeal was driven by seeing the condition of the three hostages released Saturday, and “hearing that Or (Levy) had no idea what happened to Hersh, hearing that Eli (Sharabi) was unaware his daughters and wife had been murdered.” They said they remained close with Levy’s family and that following his release one of Levy’s first questions was how Hersh was doing, unaware that he’d been killed. “He assumed that he had been released long ago,” Rachel Goldberg-Polin said.\n",
            "For a man who’s spent his career battling to make France more pro-business, Europe’s prospects on artificial intelligence are worrying: an oversight that could cost the bloc dearly. “We are not in the race today,” French President Emmanuel Macron told CNN’s Richard Quest in an exclusive interview at the Elysee Palace on Thursday. “We are lagging behind.” “We need an AI agenda,” he said, “because we have to bridge the gap with the United States and China on AI.” The French leader added that he fears Europe becoming merely an AI consumer, losing control over the future direction and development of the technology. That’s part of the impetus behind this week’s AI summit in Paris — the latest effort by Macron to put France at the heart of the debate and decision-making on international questions of the day. Macron regularly touts the prospects of Paris-based company Mistral, widely considered OpenAI’s European competitor, which launched a new app on Thursday. The company boasts of its ability to rival its US competitors, by getting the same results with less computing power needed, although the surprise arrival of lower-cost Chinese competitor DeepSeek has put pressure on the French firm. With its nuclear-heavy energy portfolio making France a net energy exporter, the country is in an enviable position for the creation of power-ravenous data centers. France is set to unveil what its government boasts is Europe’s largest supercomputer by fall 2025, outside Paris. The Mont Valerien site will be a military facility, bringing AI capabilities at scale to help solve design and engineering questions, like the architecture of France’s next aircraft carriers. AI will also be used to improve future military technologies and practices, like anti-drone jamming, according to the French Ministry of Defense. That’s the exception. With Europe holding a mere 3-5% of global computing power, Macron said he hopes this surplus power will open doors to Europe’s AI future. He has his sights on building 20% of the world’s data centers. But financing — especially from the United States and the Gulf Arab states — will be key, according to Macron. It’s where Europe “must do much better,” Macron said. Finding cash within the continent could be an unwitting boon if President Donald Trump’s tariff threats against European allies come to a head. “From the standpoint of America, the EU treats us very, very unfairly, very badly,” Trump told the World Economic Forum in January, later threatening to levy tariffs against the bloc after slapping — and then rescinding — stiff import taxes on Canada and Mexico. Trump’s 10% across-the-board tariffs on China still went into effect, and the president said he will announce new so-calledreciprocal tariffsnext week that could hit all corners of the world. Trump has railed against the US trade deficit with the European Union, which increased by $26.9 billion to $235.6 billion in 2024,according to US government figures. Macron pushed back against this, arguing the trade deficit ignores Europe’s significant spending on digital services, which is often excluded from such calculations. In response to potential tariffs, Macron said Europe must look to protect producers against American and Chinese competition and, crucially, ease regulation on investments to stem the “leaking” of European savings to the United States. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen mirrored that resolute stance last week. Competitiveness is key, Macron told CNN. “I will fight for AI,” he said, calling for a business environment that makes Europe more competitive. “I will fight for more defence and security answers as Europeans. And I will fight for the maximum level of ambition on all these issues.” February and March will bring announcements and a roadmap of reforms around AI startup regulations, Macron said, in an effort to rival the United States and China’s AI agenda. “We have to focus on killing some crazy regulations, simplification of the current environment,” Macron said. “Europe has to simplify its rules, make it much more business friendly and synchronize with the United States.” He hopes, for AI at least, this week’s summit will be a “wake up call” for Europe.\n",
            "US President Donald Trump signedan executive orderFriday aimed at freezing assistance to South Africa over a controversial law that allows the government to seize farmland from ethnic minorities — namely White farmers — without compensation, as well as the country’s stance against Israel and its war in Gaza. Trump said in the order the United States would no longer support South Africa with foreign aid if such policies, which he claims highlight a “shocking disregard for its citizens” and amount to “human rights violations,” continue, ordering US agencies to stop providing any aid to South Africa unless deemed necessary. South African President Cyril Ramaphosahas previously deniedthat South African authorities were “confiscating land” and said his country was looking forward to working with the Trump administration “over our land reform policy.” Trump’s order also directs the United States to assist Afrikaners — an ethnic group descended from European settlers — who are fleeing South Africa due to discrimination, including helping them resettle through refugee programs. “It is the policy of the United States that, as long as South Africa continues these unjust and immoral practices that harm our Nation, the United States shall not provide aid or assistance to South Africa; and the United States shall promote the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation,” read the order. South Africa’sforeign ministrycalled the order a “great concern” and said it “(lacked) factual accuracy and fails to recognize South Africa’s profound and painful history of colonialism and apartheid,” adding that the move seemed “to be a campaign of misinformation and propaganda aimed at misrepresenting our great nation.” “It is ironic that the executive order makes provision for refugee status in the US for a group in South Africa that remains amongst the most economically privileged, while vulnerable people in the US from other parts of the world are being deported and denied asylum despite real hardship,” the foreign ministry added in a statement Saturday. In the past, racist policies forcefully removed Black and non-White South Africans from land for White people to use. There has been a land redistribution and restitution provision in the country’s constitution since South Africa emerged from its apartheid era and held its first democratic elections in 1994. Unemployment and poverty, however, remain acute among Black South Africans, who make up around 80% of the population, yet own a fraction of the land. In January, Ramaphosa signed a bill into law that sets forth new guidelines for land expropriation, including enabling the government to expropriate land without compensation in some cases. According to the US Foreign Assistancewebsite, the country said it would send nearly $440 million in assistance to South Africa in 2023, including more than $270 million just from the Agency for International Development (USAID). The executive order comes as the Trump administration has alreadyfrozen almost all foreign assistanceand made moves todismantle USAID. Trump also said in his order that South Africa had taken an aggressive stance against the United States and its allies through its position on Israel and reinvigorating ties with Iran. South Africa accused Israel of committing genocide in anunprecedented caseat the United Nations’ top court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ). It said Israel’s leadership was “intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza” and called for the court to order a halt to Israel’s military campaign in the enclave. Trump has previously said he would halt funding until there was a full investigation into allegations that “South Africa is confiscating land and treating certain classes of people very badly,” without citing evidence. Ramaphosa also spoke to Trump’s “first buddy” and South African-born Elon Musk earlier this week “on issues of misinformation and distortions about South Africa,” emphasizing South Africa’s constitutionally embedded values of the respect for the rule of law, justice, fairness and equality,” a government statement at the time read. During his annual state of the nation address, Ramaphosa said South Africa “will not be deterred.” “We are, as South Africans, a resilient people, and we will not be bullied,” he said.\n",
            "Whenthree Israeli hostagesemerged at the weekend, emaciated and gaunt after 16 months in Hamas captivity, Israelis were shocked by the images. But inside the Israeli government, top officials were not surprised. The Israeli government has had intelligence for months indicating that many of the remaining living hostages are in poor health, two Israeli officials tell CNN. “It wasn’t a surprise for us,” one Israeli official said. And many of the remaining Israeli hostages are also believed to be in even worse condition, the officials said. “From this moment onward, we expect worse scenes,” a second Israeli official said. Eli Sharabi, Or Levy and Ohad Ben Ami were paraded by Hamas militants duringa handover ceremonyon Saturday, the three latest Israeli hostages to be freed by the militant group since the implementation of the ceasefire-for-hostages deal between Israel and Hamas. The three men appeared drastically thinner than before their release, and their relatives subsequently raised concerns about their physical and mental treatment during their captivity. Hamas has sincepostponed the next hostage releasescheduled to take place in Gaza on Saturday “until further notice,” accusing Israel of breaking the ceasefire deal. This has heightened fears surrounding the status and wellbeing of the dozens of Israelis still being held in the enclave. Israel’s intelligence indicates that Hamas has been treating male hostages worse than female captives, the second official said, and there is especially heightened concern for the condition of the male soldiers held captive by Hamas. Many male hostages have been fed less and kept in far worse conditions, the officials added, citing Israeli assessments. Evidence supporting that intelligence has only grown in recent days, as the freed hostages and their families described elements of their captivity. Or Levy’s brother Michael said when he saw his brother on Saturday for the first time in 16 months, he wasn’t the same person who left home on October 7, 2023. “He came back in poor physical condition. Anyone who saw the pictures and videos couldn’t ignore it. For 16 months, he was hungry, barefoot and in constant fear that every day can be his last,” Michael said, according to the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters. Returning hostages said that several male hostages were being held in chains and are severely malnourished. In a heart-wrenching interview on Israel’s Channel 12, the mother of 24-year-old hostage Alon Ohel shared what she had learned about her son. “He has shrapnel in his eye, he has shrapnel in his shoulder, he has shrapnel in his arm. Alon was bound in chains, this entire time, and he had almost no food — at most one pita a day, over a very, very, very long time, more than a year,” Idit Ohel said. Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, Ella Ben Ami said her father, Ohad, “went through hell” in Gaza and noted that the remaining Israeli hostages are suffering the same conditions her father did. “I had many pictures in my mind of my dad, but nothing prepared me for those pictures of him on that stage in Gaza. I was sure that I would be strong, but I fell on the floor and screamed, ‘I’m sorry,’” she said. The Israeli military meanwhile said on Tuesday that Shlomo Mantzur, who at 85 was the oldest hostage taken on October 7, was killed during the Hamas-led attack and his body has since been held in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces said Tuesday they notified his family after confirmation of his death “based on intelligence gathered in recent months” and following approval by a committee of the Ministry of Health, in cooperation with the Ministry of Religious Services and the Israeli Police.\n",
            "A woman who kept Yazidi women and children as slaves inRaqqa, Syria, during the rule of the terror group ISIS was on Tuesday jailed by a Swedish court on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and gross war crimes. Six children and three women from the ethnic and religious Yazidi group were kept imprisoned by the woman for months in 2015, the Stockholm District Court said ina statement. The woman was not named by the court. While being held as slaves, the victims were forced to participate in Islamic religious practices, forbidden to observe their own religion and culture,and ordered to perform domestic chores, the court said. Some of the victims were also “assaulted and molested,” it added. ISIS considered Raqqa the capital of its self-proclaimed “caliphate,” seizing the city in 2014. Raqqa’s national hospital and stadium wereturned into ISIS headquarters, and public executions were carried out in the city’s main square. ISIS killed and enslavedhundreds of thousandsof Iraqi Yazidis, capturing the women and children and murdering the men. The group victimized by the woman sentenced on Tuesday were taken captive in August 2014, Stockholm District Court said, after ISIS carried out attacks on Yazidi villages in Northern Iraq’s Sinjar district. Their male relatives were killed in the attacks, the court said. Before being imprisoned by the woman, the victims were kept as slaves by different male ISIS members, living “in very meagre conditions without food and clean water,” according to the court. The women were “subjected to systematic rape” by the male ISIS members, it added. The victims were then moved to the woman’s home, where they were held and abused for up to five months, the court said. After this, she helped transfer the victims to be enslaved by other ISIS members. Some of the victims were freed via smugglers a couple of months after they left the woman’s home, the court said, but three of the children did not become free until years later. One young woman has not been found, it added. “The crimes do not only constitute an exceptionally serious violation of the life and integrity of specific individuals, but also of fundamental human values and humanity,” the court said. “To exercise the powers attaching to right of ownership over another human being is a tremendous violation of the integrity of that person, as it deprives the person of their human dignity,” it continued.\n",
            "Two tourists have died from suspected pesticide poisoning after their hostel inSri Lankawas fumigated forbedbugs, Britain’s PA Media news agency has reported. Ebony McIntosh, a 24-year-old digital marketing and social media manager from the English city of Derby, and 26-year-old Nadine Raguse from Germany were both staying in the Miracle Colombo City hostel in the Sri Lankan capital, PA reported Sri Lanka Police as saying on Thursday. They both fell ill after a room at the hostel was fumigated to treat bedbugs, Sri Lanka Police spokesman Buddhika Manatunga told PA, and McIntosh was hospitalized on Saturday. Officers are investigating whether the two women were poisoned by pesticides, the Manatunga said. He added that an autopsy to determine McIntosh’s cause of death will take place after her family arrives in Sri Lanka on Monday. Manatunga said the hostel, which is currently closed, will remain shut until then, according to PA. A spokesperson for the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) told PA: “We are supporting the family of a British woman who died in Sri Lanka, and are in contact with the local authorities.” CNN has reached out to the FCDO for further comment. McIntosh’s family have launched a GoFundMe page to raise money for their travel to Sri Lanka. “We are absolutely heartbroken to share that our beautiful baby girl and big sister Ebony has passed away unexpectedly on the Saturday 1st February 2025, thousands of miles away from home,” McIntosh’s family wrote on the page. “Words cannot begin to express how broken we are, it’s been like a nightmare since we found out on Sunday morning, we have prayed and prayed that this can’t be true. It couldn’t possibly happen to our lovely Ebs,” they continued. The family wrote that McIntosh flew from London to Sri Lanka on Tuesday, January 28, to “follow her dreams of travelling all over South Asia,” and that she was “full of excitement,” having spent months planning. They added that McIntosh and “several others” were rushed to hospital on Saturday after suffering from vomiting and nausea, and that McIntosh also had difficulty breathing. The family said she died within a few hours of arriving at the hospital.\n",
            "Art historians studying a painting byPablo Picassohave uncovered the mysterious portrait of a woman, hiddenbeneath its surface. The portrait of the woman was lost when Picasso painted over it, probably a few months afterward, in 1901 to depict his sculptor friend Mateu Fernández de Soto sitting at a table in hues of blues and greens. But, almost 125 years later, the original portrait’s outlines have been revealed by the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, when they examined the artwork using infrared and X-ray imaging ahead of an exhibition. The portrait of the woman “literally emerged before our eyes … piece-by-piece,” because of the mosaic-like way an infrared camera scans an image, Barnaby Wright, deputy head of the Courtauld Gallery, explained. Though experts “were fairly convinced there was something lurking underneath the surface because … you can see brushstrokes … that didn’t really relate to the finished portrait,” they didn’t know what they would find once they began scanning it, Wright told CNN on Monday. They are still unsure of the woman’s identity, though she resembles several other women Picasso painted in Paris in 1901, as she shares the distinctivechignonhairstyle that was fashionable in the French capital at the time. “She may forever be a sort of anonymous model,” Wright said, adding that they are working on identifying her. “She might have been just someone who modeled for Picasso … she might have been a lover, she might have been a friend.” Picasso was just 19 years old when he arrived in Paris in 1901 but he was already finding different ways to paint his subjects. By abandoning this earlier portrait and painting over it, Picasso was probably “not just changing the subject but also changing his style as he developed his famous Blue Period way of painting,” Wright said. During his Blue Period, Picasso used more somber colors to depict his subjects as he departed from his earlier Impressionistic style, a change that was in part influenced by the suicide of his good friend Carlos Casagemas. X-ray imaging suggests Picasso reworked this canvas perhaps as many as three or four times, partly because he couldn’t easily afford to buy new materials but also because “it’s clear he … enjoyed the process of turning one image into another,” Wright said. “He didn’t whitewash the canvas in between changing its subject to give him a clean slate. He painted the figure of his friend directly on top of the woman … one figure is emerging from the other, transforming one into the other.” Still, remnants of the woman’s portrait remain visible to the trained eye. “Once you know what’s underneath from this technical image and you take that back to the finished painting, you can see some of those marks very clearly—her eye and her ear and her hair,” Wright said. “This ghostly presence of the woman, is actually not just below the surface but it’s actually sort of pressing into the surface itself.” “Portrait of Mateu Fernández de Soto”will be on display at the Courtauld Gallery in London from February 14 to May 26.\n",
            "The first of this week’sback-to-back-to-back winter stormsis dumping snow, ice and rain over a 1,500 mile stretch of the eastern US Tuesday. The second winter storm will hit some of the same areas in quick succession and dump the most substantial snow of the season over Chicago. The third storm is the most serious flood threat Southern California has faced since January’sdevastating wildfires. Each is another link in a chain of disruptive storms unbroken since the start of February. Here’s the latest: •Snowingin DC:Snow began in the mid-afternoon in the nation’s capital and will continue overnight. Up to 6 inches of snow will pile up which could snarl travel during the afternoon and evening commute. As much snow as the past two winters combined has already fallen in Washington, DC this winter. •Snow ispiling up:Snow was falling from Kentucky to the mid-Atlantic Tuesday afternoon. Widespread snow totals of 3 to 6 inches have already coated areas from central Kentucky to western Virginia. Around 1 to 3 inches has fallen farther east in Virginia. There’s more to come into Wednesday morning as the storm tracks east. •Power outages and treacherous travel likely:Significant amounts of ice – more than 0.25 inches – are possible through Wednesday in parts of West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina. “Ice accumulations could make many roads treacherous and impassable,” the National Weather Service warned Tuesday. “The weight of ice on tree limbs and power lines could produce numerous outages.” Tuesday’s storm is tracking farther south than either of last week’s and putting areas that avoided a wintry mess right in the thick of it. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency, and the Virginia Department of Transportation urged residents to “stay off the roads.” The Virginia National Guard staged dozens of soldiers to aid with storm response. Portions of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, a key roadway that runs alongside the Potomac River, is closed because of the weather, the National Park Servicesaid. A band of snow is falling north of an area of the Appalachians expected to get the worst ice. Heavy snow will pile up quickly in some areas, including Washington, DC. As many as 1,100 additional workers traveling from North Carolina, Alabama, Kentucky and Ohio were requested by Appalachian Power to help as snow, ice and rain are expected to hit the area, the utility company said Tuesday. “Ice accumulations over a quarter inch weigh down trees and electric lines, which can cause substantial utility problems,” the company said. Snow will also blanket parts of Pennsylvania into New Jersey and southern New England. New York City will likely see an inch or two of snow. Heavy rain is drenching an area to the south on the warmer side of the storm. There’s a risk of flooding over a wide area of the South through Wednesday. A level 2 of 4 risk is in place for parts of every state from Texas to the Carolinas — including many areas still recovering from Hurricane Helene — during this time, according to the Weather Prediction Center. The next storm will form in the central US while its predecessor is still bringing snow and ice to the East and rain to the South. Snow, ice and rain are expected in the Plains overnight Tuesday intoWednesday morning. Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly issued a state of disaster emergency proclamation on Sunday due to the storm. The wintry mess will quickly expand Wednesday to encompass much of the Midwest and parts of the Northeast by the evening. The bulk of the storm will be on the East Coast by Thursday morning with snow and ice blanketing the Northeast and rain falling farther south. Some parts of the East will only have a few hours between when the first storm ends and the second begins. Snow totals from this storm will be highest in the Plains and Midwest. They could approach double digits in Kansas City, Missouri, on Wednesday – close to double what the city typically gets in all of February. Double-digit snow is also possible in Chicago Wednesday, which would be enough to be the city’s most substantial so far this season. Just over 7 inches of snow have fallen since December when the city typically records almost two feet by now. Ice will present a significant problem again just south of where the heaviest snow falls. At least a light glaze of ice — enough to make travel tricky — is possible anywhere from Oklahoma and Kansas through the Ohio Valley and Northeast. Parts of the Appalachians will get another round of ice from this storm. A few of the locations hit hardest from the first storm might not notice a break between the two storms as icy precipitation slows but doesn’t completely stop Wednesday afternoon. This storm will reinvigorate rain and thunderstorms in the South Wednesday. Some thunderstorms could turn severe in parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama starting in the afternoon and a Level 2 of 5 threat is in place. The storm will largely come to an end by Thursday night. This storm will be different than the previous two in that it will first slam into California fully formed. The atmospheric river-fueled storm will pack a significant punch and from the start with rain beginning along much of the state’s coast early Thursday morning. Rain will get heavier throughout the day as it reaches farther inland and spreads over the entire length of the state. The upcoming storm will be the “most significant” so far this winter in Southern California, Ariel Cohen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Los Angeles, warned Tuesday. Portions of California’s Los Angeles and Ventura counties – including areas burned by the Palisades and Eaton fires – are under a Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall Thursday, according to the WPC. More than 35 million in the rest of the state are under a level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall Thursday. The threat area encompasses San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego and areas in between. Heavy rain presents an even greater risk to areas burned by recentdeadly wildfires. “Given the elevated chances for significant debris flows consisting of raging torrents of rockslides and mudslides that can be damaging and even deadly, now is the time to start getting prepared for these potentially dangerous conditions,” Cohen urged. The threat to the burn scar areas comes as officials are tackling the effort to remove hazardous debris left behind by the fires. Los Angeles County recentlybolsteredstorm preparations by cleaning debris basins, installing concrete barriers, and placing sandbags in fire zones to filter debris and protect storm drains. More than 7,500 feet of concrete barriers and more than 6,500 sandbags have been deployed to areas burned in the Palisades Fire in case of debris flows, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced Tuesday. Thursday’s flood risk will not be confined to areas scorched by wildfires. This storm will dump 1 to 3 inches of rain over the Los Angeles basin and totals could approach 6 inches in the area’s mountains – including the burn scar of the Palisades Fire. “Of course we’re concerned about the Palisades and the burned areas, but this is for all of Los Angeles to be concerned about the rain and the impacts,” Bass implored. This storm will also bring heavy snow to California’s Sierra Nevada and mountainous areas of the West. It will track east Thursday night and Friday and reach the Plains by early Saturday morning. A boost of atmospheric energy will reinvigorate the potent storm and significantly expand its size once it reaches the central US. Snow will blast over the Midwest Saturday and reach much of the Northeast by the evening. Some sleet and ice may mix with snow in the Northeast with mainly rain drenching areas farther south Saturday night. Heavy rain and thunderstorms will dominate the warm side of this storm. Some thunderstorms could become severe, especially in parts of the South. Dangerous thunderstorms can happen at any time of the year – someturned deadlylast week in Tennessee. The large storm will continue to pound the East Coast Sunday before coming to an end by Monday morning. But it may not be the end of a busy winter storm pattern as another storm is possible by the middle of next week.\n",
            "Awide-reaching stormforced water rescues, knocked out power to tens of thousands and made for dangerous travel as it hit the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Thursday. It’s a preview of the frenetic winter storm activity to come this month. At least two other storms are expected into next week, including one that hit California Thursday and will impact the same regions over the weekend. Very heavy rain on the southern, warmer side of Thursday’s storm prompted the first flash flood emergencies of the year in parts of eastern Kentucky and West Virginia.Flash flood emergenciesare the most severe level of flash flood warning and indicate that life-threatening flooding is occurring. First responders performed at least 20 water rescues Thursday in West Virginia’s Kanawha County, where Charleston is located. Some roads in the county remained impassible due to flooding mid-morning, according to county manager Jeremy Young. “We can’t stress enough to not drive through high water for any reason at all,” first responders in Kanawha County urged onsocial mediaThursday morning. There were also multiple tornado warnings as a line of severe thunderstorms tracked across Kentucky and into West Virginia Thursday morning. At least oneconfirmed tornadospawned from these storms near Booneville, in eastern Kentucky’s Owsley County, while there werereports of a possible tornadocausing “significant damage and injury” in Tennessee’s Morgan County. The National Weather Service also warned that the possible tornado had damaged several houses and toppled trees. More than 90,000 homes and businesses lost power in Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey Thursday because of severe thunderstorms and ice. An icy mix stretched from central Virginia into Upstate New York and parts of New England Thursday — including in Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York City. Dangerous amounts of ice up to 0.30 inches accumulated in parts of Pennsylvania, western Maryland and West Virginia. It was enough to weigh down trees and power lines — causing power outages — and made travel dangerous to borderline impossible. Traffic crashes were reported in Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania Thursday morning in the icy mess. Two people were injured when a transport ambulance rolled over and crashed in eastern Pennsylvania’s Schuylkill County Thursday morning, CNN affiliateWFMZreported. Sleet and freezing rain were ongoing in the region at the time, weather observations show. Flight delays and cancellations also stacked up. More than 500 flights into or out of the US were cancelled and 2,800 were delayed. Airports in Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Boston and the New York City area experienced the most issues. Snow, sleet, freezing rain and rain expanded into much of New England Thursday afternoon after precipitation largely ended in southern parts of the Northeast. Precipitation will fully come to an end by the evening for much of the Northeast but linger into the earliest hours of Friday morning in northern New England. It will remain slick where air temperatures remain near or below freezing. The ongoing storm is just the first of an incredibly active stretch of winter storms expected across the northern tier of the US over the next week or two. The jet stream, essentially a river of air in the atmosphere that storms flow through, is locked in an almost perfect line from west to east, and will continue to funnel storms across the northern tier of the Lower 48. New storms will arrive every few days until the jet stream shifts — something that might not happen until the second half of February. The next storm will take less than 72 hours to go from coast to coast. It pushed into the West Coast Thursday night, and will track through the northern Rockies and northern Plains Friday before strengthening Saturday. Central and Northern California saw up to three inches of rain over 24 hours as of late Thursday, with flood watches in place north of the San Francisco Bay area until Friday afternoon. The storm has prompted wind alerts for around 30 million people across the West through Friday morning, where gusts to 55 mph are possible. Gusts to this level could blow down tree limbs and cause scattered power outages. The storm’s exact timing, type and amount of precipitation could shift, but another bout of disruptive icing is possible for the Midwest and Northeast. Some areas will only have a little over 24 hours between when impacts from the first storm end and troubles from the second one begin. Snow will begin early Saturday over the northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Precipitation will expand as the storm is boosted by atmospheric energy to its south and a mix of freezing rain and rain will stretch from Missouri to the central Appalachians by Saturday morning while snow falls over the Great Lakes. There could be a dry gap for the start of Saturday between the two areas of wintry precipitation that includes an area from Chicago to Cleveland. These dry areas will eventually fill in with an icy mix by the late afternoon. A mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow will spread over Pennsylvania by Saturday night. The same messy mix will reach the rest of the Northeast overnight. Slightly more snow is possible in New England during this weekend’s storm than with the ongoing storm Thursday, but some mixing is still likely to tamp down snow totals. Additional storms are possible next week for the eastern half of the country as the active pattern continues.Forecast models are hinting at another wide-reaching storm next Tuesday and Wednesday, and yet another storm around the middle of the month.\n",
            "The number of new marriages recorded in China fell to a record low last year, despite sweeping government efforts to encourage young people to tie the knot and have babies to halt demographic decline in the world’s second-largest economy. Some 6.1 million couples registered their marriages in 2024, a plunge of 20.5% from the previous year, according to data released Saturday by China’s Ministry of Civil Affairs. It marks a record low since the ministry started releasing the statistics in 1986. Plummeting marriages – and births – pose a severe challenge to Beijing, as it grapples with the pressure of a shrinking workforce and rapidly aging population on the country’s slowing economy. The sharp drop in the number of marriages in 2024 resumed the decade-long decline since 2013, after a brief rebound in 2023 following the lifting of stringent Covid restrictions. Last year’s figure was less than half of the 13 million marriages registered at the peak in 2013. The data released on Saturday also showed a slight increase in the number of divorces. Last year, nearly 2.6 million couples registered for divorce, an increase of 28,000 from 2023. China has mandated a 30-day “cooling-off” period for people filing for divorce since 2021, despite criticism that it could make it harder for women to leave broken or even abusive marriages. China’s population hasshrunk for three years in a rowdespite a slight increase in the birth rate last year. The working population, classified as those between the ages of 16 and 59, also declined by 6.83 million last year, adding to an ongoing contraction. The population of those over 60, meanwhile, continued to expand, to account for 22% of the total population. Chinese officials see a direct link between fewer marriages and falling births in the country, where social norms andgovernment regulationsmake it challenging for unmarried couples to have children. To reverse the decline, Chinese officials have rolled out a raft of measures, from financial incentives to propaganda campaigns, to nudge young people to tie the knot and have children. Officials have organized blind dating events, mass weddings, and attempted to curtail the tradition of large “bride price” payments from the groom to his future wife’s family that put marriage out of reach for many poor men in rural areas. Some local governments have even handed out cash incentives for young couples to get married. Since 2022, China’s Family Planning Association has launched programs to create a “new-era marriage and childbearing culture,” enrolling dozens of cities to promote the “social value of childbearing” and encouraging young people to get married and give birth at an “appropriate age.” But so far, these policies have failed to convince Chinese young adults who are grappling with high unemployment, the rising cost of living and the lack of robust social welfare support amid the economic slowdown. Many are postponing marriage and childbirth – and a growing number of young people even choose to eschew them entirely. “Life is so exhausting, how could there be the courage to get married? Sigh,” said a top comment on Chinese social platform Weibo on Sunday, in response to news of the record-low marriages. The decline in both marriages and births is partly due to decades of policies designed to limit China’s population growth, which resulted in fewer young people of marriageable age, according to Chinese officials and sociologists. In 2015, China announced an end to its decades-long one-child policy, allowing couples to have two children, then increased that tothree children in 2021– but both marriage and birth rates continued to drop. The stubborn downward trend is also a result of changing attitudes to marriage, especially among young women who are becoming more educated and financially independent. Faced withwidespread workplace discriminationand patriarchal traditions – such as the expectation for women to be responsible for childcare and housework – some women aregrowing disillusioned with marriage.\n",
            "The City of London financial district has approved plans for a 73-floor skyscraper that will match in height Western Europe’stallest towera mile to the south, in a sign that city planners are still betting on the office market despite the current downturn. The proposed 309.6-meter (1,015.75-foot) tower, which will be exactly the same height as London’s Shard, was given the go-ahead after a previously approved plan was revised “to better respond to post-pandemic office needs,” the City of London local authority said on Friday. Officially called 1 Undershaft, the tower was initially granted approval at a slightly smaller height in 2016 but never started. The proposed building, which investor Aroland has been trying to get off the ground for years, will require the demolition of an existing smaller tower and has attracted criticism from conservation groups. Historic England said in a consultation response to City planners in February that the alterations had not altered its impact and said it would “seriously degrade” the public realm around it. The tower, if built, would provide 154,156 square meters (around 1.66 million square feet) of office space, areas for children’s education on the 72nd and 73rd floors and a publicly accessible garden. London’s office market has been hit hard by higher borrowing costs and more home working post-pandemic, although premium space has remained in demand. Very few major London office properties have been sold this year. Investors Nuveen and Brookfield are currently trying to sell London office towers, in a major test for investor appetite. The supply of new space to let in London has slowed since the pandemic. However, office construction in the City has recently bucked the trend, with new starts up 7% between April and September this year, compared to falls in every other central London market surveyed by Deloitte. Critics say London’s skyline has become increasingly cluttered by generic glass-and-metal towers that dwarf historic landmarks, especially in the City of London, home to St. Paul’s Cathedral. “As another, much needed office development gets approved in the City of London, it speaks to the confidence that global investors have in the London real estate market and the UK economy more widely,” said Shravan Joshi, chairman of the City of London Corporation’s Planning and Transportation Committee. The Shard, currently the tallest skyscraper in Western Europe, was completed in 2012.\n",
            "As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returns from a week-long trip to Washington, toting a fantastical and radical Gaza plan from the American president, he finds a country at a crossroads. Will Israel return to war in Gaza? Or will the ceasefire hold, and more Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners see freedom? US President Donald Trump wants America to control Gaza and for the 2.1 million Palestinians who live there to leave. The gaunt appearance of three Israelis released from Hamas captivity has traumatized the nation. A month-old ceasefire expires in just over two weeks and talks to extend it have barely begun, if at all. Memories and images of the Holocaust have always loomed over the Israeli psyche. But now, at a critical time in the 16-month-long Gaza war, a battle to define the lessons of that slaughter is being played out across Israeli society. On Saturday, Israelis gathered around their televisions as they have every weekend for a month, to see their compatriots released from more than a year of captivity in Gaza. Hamas’ highly staged handover ceremonies are fraught. Just a week ago, many Israelis got flashbacks to the scenes of October 7, 2023, asmilitants pushedArbel Yehoud through a jostling crowd. But the nation was not prepared for theimage of three skeletal figures– Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy – as Hamas militants led them from a van in Deir al-Balah this weekend. Emaciated, with sunken faces, the three appeared barely able to walk on their own. To many, the image drew immediate parallels to the survivors of Nazi death camps. “The three who returned today are Holocaust survivors,” Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is still held in Gaza, said later that day. When the prime minister expressed outrage at their appearance, the opposition leader Yair Lapid hit back: “Netanyahu, did you just now discover that the condition of the hostages is dire?” Hamas and its allies continue to hold 73 hostages taken on October 7, of whom at least 34 are believed to be dead by the Israeli government. Netanyahuhas long been accused, with some evidence, of deliberately blocking previous ceasefire deals. In a tell-all interview with Israel’s Channel 12 on Thursday, the former defense minister Yoav Gallant – fired by Netanyahu last year after months of tension – agreed. “This offer from early July that Hamas agreed to is identical to the offer now, only less good in some respects,” he said of the ceasefire agreement adopted in January. “There are fewer live hostages, unfortunately. More time has passed. And we are paying a heavier price here, because there are at least 110 more murderers who will be released in this process.” Previous hostages have been freed in relative health – albeit, doctors say, malnourished and traumatized. With the release of the three gaunt men this weekend, Hamas appeared to be sending a message at a critical moment. “Seeing the three hostages this morning as if they had been liberated from World War II concentration camps should compel us all to accelerate the release of all hostages,” the veteran Israeli negotiator-turned-peace activist Gershon Baskin said on Saturday. Even the US president weighed in. “They look like they’ve aged 25 years,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday. “They literally look like the old pictures of Holocaust survivors. The same thing.” It should be noted, of course, that many Palestinian prisoners who have been released from Israeli jails say that they were deliberately starved. Mohammad El-Halabi, an aid worker who was charged in 2016 with funneling money to Hamas in a case disputed by international human rights groups, was among those released earlier this month. “The food was not even sufficient for a small child,”he told CNN. The Israel Prison Service says that “all prisoners are detained according to the law,” and that people can file complaints if they feel they have been mistreated. Just as some see in the Holocaust an argument to accelerate a deal for more hostages, others draw on a deep strain in Israeli culture – that, no matter what, Jews will never again be victims. “We became a nation of victims – we were the perfect victim,” Netanyahutold Fox Newsthis weekend. “I don’t seek wars – I seek to end wars. But if a war is foisted on me, like these monsters foisted on us, we will defeat them. And we will achieve total victory over them. No question about that.” Speaking on Holocaust Remembrance Day last year, he said that “a straight line, as sinister as can be, connects the murderers of old to the murderers of today.” Though his foreign minister, Gideon Saar, also drew the comparison between the Holocaust and the gaunt Israeli hostages released this weekend, Netanyahu has so far avoided their comparison. His extremist finance minister is similarly skeptical. “The suffering of our hostages in Hamas’ brutal captivity is heartbreaking,” Bezalel Smotrich said this weekend. “But comparisons to the Holocaust are a grave mistake and are based on the contempt for the Holocaust.” His opinions carry weight. Smotrich is at the height of his powers. After Itamar Ben Gvir quit his post as national security minister over the Gaza ceasefire, Smotrich’s right-wing Religious Zionism party became the keystone to Netanyahu’s ability to govern. He has also threatened to quit, if Israel doesn’t return to war in Gaza. It is little surprise that Netanyahu waited until this weekend – a week after a deadline for further ceasefire talks – to send a delegation to Qatar. Israeli media is rife with speculation that he is simply running out the clock until phase one of the deal expires on March 1. “We’re going to get 75% of the living hostages out,”he told Fox News, before hastening to add: “Which – and I intend to get all of them out.” If Netanyahu does return Israel to war in Gaza, Trump’s desire for Palestinians to leave will become unavoidable. Trump’s plan is radical. If Palestinians were forced to leave – or encouraged, by prolonging dire humanitarian conditions – it would almost certainly constitute ethnic cleansing under international law. But Trump has recognized, in the simplistic way of a populist, that paying lip service to the two-state solution has only entrenched the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “We’re going to finish Hamas off,” Netanyahu said in that interview. “And what happens then? Do we leave the people there with all that devastation? Do you say, ‘Well, they have to stay in, confined?’ Because nobody lets them leave. Everybody describes Gaza as the biggest open-air prison in the world. You know why? Because they’re not allowed to leave.” Never one to waste an opportunity, Ben Gvir – a far-right politician who carries a conviction of incitement to racism and supporting a terror organization – also seized on the hostages’ appearance. “This is a holocaust,” he said. “Encourage voluntary immigration now.”\n",
            "The families of thethree Israeli hostages releasedSaturday have spoken out about their loved ones’ ordeal in Hamas captivity, saying they hope their suffering provides impetus to efforts to free all those still in Gaza as soon as possible. Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy appeared gaunt and frail as they were paraded by the militants on a makeshift stage in Gaza before they were handed over to the Red Cross. Their appearance was condemned as “shocking” by Israel, which has said the scenes will “not go unaddressed.” Ella Ben Ami, daughter of Ohad, spoke of her horror at watching Hamas parade her father on the stage. “I had many pictures in my mind of my dad, but nothing prepared me for those pictures of him on that stage in Gaza. I was sure that I would be strong, but I fell on the floor and screamed, ‘I’m sorry,’” she said. Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, Ella Ben Ami said her father “went through hell” in Gaza and noted that the remaining Israeli hostages are suffering the same conditions her father did. She called on the Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “find a way” to bring them all home. “We have to keep going to Phase B, and have to bring everybody back,” she said referring to the second phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal, which is supposed to see the return of the remaining hostages and was expected to be discussed in a “a security-political cabinet meeting” held by Netanyahu this weekend. Or Levy’s brother Michael said when he saw his brother on Saturday for the first time in 16 months, he wasn’t the same person who left home on October 7, 2023. “He came back in poor physical condition. Anyone who saw the pictures and videos couldn’t ignore it. For 16 months, he was hungry, barefoot and in constant fear that every day can be his last,” Michael said, according to the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters. After his release, Or received the heartbreaking news that his wife Einav had been killed in the October 7 attack. “The hardest blow was yesterday when Or discovered that Einav, the love of his life, was murdered on that terrible day. For 491 days, he held onto hope that he would return to her,” Michael said. He went on to call for the immediate release of the remaining hostages, saying, “Or’s return is a miracle, but we can’t rest until every single one of them is back with their families.” Eli Sharabi’s brother Sharon described the return of the three hostages as a victory for the Israeli people but said the government must work with a sense of urgency to save the other hostages, the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters said. Yossi, another brother in the family, was also taken hostage by Hamas but he subsequently died in Gaza. “Every moment that passes, every second could save lives from Hamas tunnels, from this cruel enemy that has massacred us since October 7,” Sharon said. Hamas has now released a total of 16 Israeli hostages as part of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, of a total of 33 promised at staggered intervals during this stage. Eight of those 33 are dead, according to the Israeli government. Following the release of the three hostages on Saturday, Hamas and its allies still hold a total of 73 people taken from Israel onOctober 7, 2023, of 251 initially taken. Three additional hostages, held captive since 2014, are still in Gaza.\n",
            "Yrjö Kukkapuro, a renowned Finnish designer whose postmodern style of chairs graced waiting rooms, offices and living rooms across Finland as well as collections in the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, has died. He was 91. His death Saturday at his home outsideHelsinkiwas confirmed by his daughter, Isa Kukkapuro-Enbom, in an email to The Associated Press on Sunday, as well as astatementfrom Studio Kukkapuro, where she is the curator. The cause of death was not disclosed. “Almost every Finn has sat on a chair he designed — at a metro station, in a bank, at school, or in a library,” the studio said in a news release. “Yrjö Kukkapuro never stopped designing and coming up with new ideas. Until the very end, he pondered a concept of his new chair, the plan of which was clear in his mind. His assistant didn’t have time to make drawings of the chair.” In a career spanning more than 70 years, Kukkapuro’s chairs were lauded for their comfort, functionalism and ergonomics as well as their design, and featured names like Ateljee, Karuselli-chair, Long Chair and, his most famous, the Experiment. Designed in 1982, the Experiment chair was considered avant-guarde but ultimately became commercially successful and was seen as a key turning point for the postmodern style of furniture. The Experiment includes decorative, wavy armrests in bright colors, an upholstered back and bottom, and its signature angled seat despite the frame being flat on the ground. Although initial production ceased in the 1990s, European furniture design brand Hem sought permission from Kukkapuro in 2021 to reproduce it with minor adjustments to the scale and construction. “We are saddened by the news of Yrjö’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family,” Hem founder and chief executive Petrus Palmér said in an email to AP. “He was a furniture design trailblazer, and showed us that a non-conformist approach is the only way to achieve a lasting legacy.” The Experiment chair retailed for up to 2,399 euros ($2,479) on Hem’s website Sunday, where a description called it “timeless, bold, and as compelling today as the day it was created.” “In the Experiment Chair, Kukkapuro sought to add art to Functionalism, to satisfy romantic tastes alongside meeting essential needs,” the description reads. “The result is startling, authentic, a hero of twentieth-century design.” Kukkapuro designed his family’s studio and home to feature a wave-shaped roof and floor-to-ceiling glass windows. Built in the late 1960s for him and his wife, artist Irmeli Kukkapuro, who died in 2022, it’s scheduled to become a museum next year.\n",
            "Ecuador’s center-right President Daniel Noboa fell short of securing an outright majority in the country’s general election, according to results available on Monday, setting the stage for a run-off vote against his nearest leftist rival. The second-round vote, provisionally scheduled for April, will decide if theLatin Americancountry will stick with Noboa’stough crackdown on crimeor seek an alternative voice in Luisa González amid an unprecedented security crisis fueled by the international drug trade and a steep homicide rate. Neither won the vote outright following Sunday’s tightly contested election. Noboa led the 16 candidates with 44.29% of the vote, according to Ecuador’sofficial election website. González tallied close behind Noboat at 43.85%, according to the count last updated at 11:30 a.m. ET. According to Ecuador’s Constitution, a candidate needs more than 50% of the vote to win the first round outright, or 40% with a margin of at least 10 percentage points over the next closest candidate. Noboa, the 37-year-old son of a banana tycoon, won a 2023 snap election on the back of a promise to rein in the rampant crime that has transformed the once tranquil country into one plagued by violence and turf wars between drug cartels. That vote was called after his predecessor Guillermo Lasso resigned to avoid impeachment following a series of crises. But Noboa’s 14 months in office have been no less turbulent.  Ecuador’s youngest ever president has declared numerous states of emergency, deployed military units to tackle gang activity, and began construction on a new maximum-security prison after an infamous criminal leaderescapedfrom custody last year. Noboa on Monday declared victory in the first round and promised to continue fighting. “Now, as has been the custom of this government, we will fight as we did on the first day, so that your dream of a fair and developing country is fulfilled,” he wrote on X. González, who was the runner-up in the 2023 race, is a close confidante of former leftist President Rafael Correa, a dominant figure in Ecuador’s politics. Running on a campaign to “Revive Ecuador,” González has pledged to tackle the drug trade just as vigorously as Noboa. She hailed Sunday’s preliminary results as a “great victory,” and said she was confident of winning any run-off. “Daniel Noboa represents fear, we represent hope, the change to transform this country,” González said, according to CNN en Español. The main challenges the next government will face when it takes office in May are security, the economy, a nationwide energy crisis and international relations. “Security is the biggest problem the government has had, but in a country with huge social inequalities like Ecuador, I believe that among the priorities of the less advantaged sectors are, in addition to security, health and education,” Santiago Basabe, an analyst and professor at the Universidad San Francisco de Quito, told CNNE.\n",
            "Spanish women’ssoccerclub Espanyol has expressed “complete discontent” towards the behavior of Barcelona Femení player Mapi León after the two teams faced each other on Sunday. In the 15th minute of the Barcelona derby, León appeared to touch Espanyol’s Daniela Caracas in the groin area and say something as the two players jostled for position. León has denied any wrongdoing and said there was “NO contact with (Caracas’) private parts, and certainly no intention.” Footage of the incident has since been widely shared on social media, andin a statement released on Monday, Espanyol said that the conduct of defender León “should not be overlooked” and “violated the intimacy of our player.” The club added: “Although Caracas was unable to react at the time due to the impact of the situation; later, after assimilating what had happened, she became aware of the seriousness of the gesture, but chose not to react angrily in order to avoid a disciplinary sanction that would harm the team. “In addition to what happened on the pitch, there was a regrettable response on social media, where our player has been the target of insults from hundreds of profiles.” Espanyol also said that it has made the club’s legal services available to Caracas, should she wish to take further action. Barça ended up winning the match 2-0 and is now five points clear at the top of Spain’s Liga F – the top flight of women’s soccer in the country. León, who has played more than 50 times for the Spanish national team, is a key player for Barcelona, winning five league titles and three Women’s Champions Leagues. Shesaid in a statement shared by the cluband signed with her full name, María Pilar León Cebrián: “At no time did I, nor was it my intention (to), infringe upon the intimacy of my fellow professional Daniela Caracas. “As the images show, it was part of a playing action in which she deliberately touches me and I touch her leg saying in reaction to the clash: ‘What’s up with you?’ I insist, it was just part of the game that does not warrant the importance that has been attached to it. “The idea of touching the private parts of a colleague would never enter my head, it goes against my principles and I would never do such a thing. I condemn the harassment that Daniela appears to have been suffering on social networks, which has nothing to do with me, and I offer her my most sincere support.” León also said that she reserves the right to take legal action against anyone who “might be seeking to exploit this strictly footballing incident to cause me damage and continue spreading unfounded accusations.” Barcelona said that it has nothing to add about the incident beyond the statement issued on behalf of León. CNN has contacted Liga F and Espanyol for further comment.\n",
            "What is the state of American fashion right now? It’s a question at least partly answered by New York Fashion Week, which concludes Tuesday, where brands including Calvin Klein and Thom Browne are showing their latest collections in a season marked by major debuts, returns and decisive shake-ups for American designers. Amid a wider industry reshuffling, several major labels and cult mainstays — including Proenza Schouler, Area and Helmut Lang — are absent from the schedule following the departure of their creative directors. Some heritage brands like Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren skipped the season entirely, while others showed overseas or across state lines. (Willy Chavarria, one of New York’s most prominent designers, opted to show during Paris’ menswear week;Bode, though still officially on the schedule, debuted its collection in New Orleans as part of the football- and fashion-centric GQ Bowl.) A pared-down week in New York has nonetheless seen doses of theatricality, including Marc Jacobs’ off-schedule procession of doll-like models in exaggerated silhouettes and Christian Siriano’s automotive-inspired gowns and flashy clubwear. But understated collections focused on wearability have been par for the course, from Eckhaus Latta’s “anti-snobbish” showing of leather bombers, cargo pants and casual asymmetrical dresses to Veronica Leoni’s highly anticipated first collection for Calvin Klein. In the latter brand’s first runway show since creative director Raf Simons’ departure in 2018, Leoni seemed to issue a return-to-work order, with sleek business casual attire made weightless through wide tailoring and billowing silk. “I really tried to explore beauty in the most authentic, clean, fresh and pure way,” she told reporters, including CNN, backstage. “We (were) inspired by the archive, but didn’t get into any nostalgia. We tried not to get stuck looking too much into the past.” Klein, now 82, was in attendance at his namesake label’s comeback. So too were Calvin Klein models past and present, including Kate Moss, Christy Turlington, FKA Twigs and Kendall Jenner, the last of whom walked the show in an ankle-length pinstripe coat dress. Elsewhere, Ella Emhoff, Dove Cameron, actor Cole Sprouse and Japanese Breakfast singer Michelle Zauner showed up for Collina Strada, while Katie Holmes, Whoopi Goldberg and Julianne Hough sat front row at Christian Siriano. Actress and singer Keke Palmer made appearances at both Brandon Maxwell and Sergio Hudson. Backstage, shortly before presenting his new codes of “opulent American sportswear,” Hudson spoke to the challenges facing American designers. “I don’t think there’s a lack of talent. I think it’s a lack of support,” he said, pointing to a shift in focus towards European fashion weeks. “There’s a lot of great designers here, and I just feel like they’re being ignored. We have to open up our eyes and see what we have at home.” At Christopher John Rogers’ long-awaited return to the New York schedule after a five-year hiatus — a vibrant showing of color-blocked, striped halter dresses and tasseled button-downs and pants—the designer alluded to the difficulties in maintaining an independent label. “We haven’t been immune to the recent challenges of the industry and are grateful as a brand to be here now presenting this body of work,” he said in the show notes. Ahead of Elena Velez’s runway, where mermaid and siren archetypes served as muses in netting, leather and wet, ruffled gowns, the Wisconsin-born designer called fashion “a longevity game.” “It’s one of those industries where you have to claw your way into people’s realities, and you have to impose yourself in this space to be taken seriously,” she told CNN over a phone call. In past seasons, Velez has done so through dramatic presentations — including a literal mud pit fight club — and atypical partnerships, including one with OnlyFans. In keeping with this season’s lost-at-sea mood, she said, fittingly: “There’s no plan b — I’ll sink with my ship.” Politics cast a shadow across the week’s proceedings.Less than a month into a turbulent new political administration, major fashion brands have been caught in the crosshairs of thebudding US-China trade war; it is also unclear how new anti-DEI policies will impact an industry that has often struggled to be equitable and inclusive, both on the runway and behind the scenes. Designers used the opportunity to call for community in the face of the unknown. “On the runway, we celebrate beauty and age and gender and body,” Siriano told CNN backstage. “We need fantasy. We need dreams. We need to show all of the colors and cultures that are here, especially in New York.” Prabal Gurung, whose previous collection celebrated the hope of a different political future,looked to forms of intimacy in his latest presentation. “I think, you know, we are all in the same space, confused, uncertain, anxious,” he told CNN backstage. “But one thing that I refuse to give in (to) is being reactive and giving into cynicism… So I always feel like in confusing, dystopian times, what we’re looking for is connection.” At Collina Strada, where founder and creative director Hillary Taymour celebrated a matriarchal vision of the “fempire,” two models in upcycled heirloom bridal dresses kissed on the runway, while others wore bug-eyed protective shades — “to hide our tears,” Taymour noted backstage. “Community is everything. Love your neighbors, love everyone. Trans rights, protect women, protect everyone. It’s going to be a really hard time in society, and let’s take care of each other.” Scroll down to see this season’s runway highlights, updated throughout the week.\n",
            "Sotheby’s inaugural auction in Saudi Arabia — and the country’sfirst majorinternational art and luxury auction — took place in Diriyah on Saturday with works by regional artists selling particularly well. Sotheby’s reported a full house for the “Origins” sale, which was held in a 250-seat outdoor amphitheater and featured participants from 45 countries. The sale totaled $17.28m with a sell-through rate of 67% by lot and 74% by value. Almost a third of the buyers were from Saudi Arabia. The auction offered an eclectic mix of around 120 objects. Approximately half were works of art and a quarter watches and jewelry, while there were also 17 designer handbags and several items of sports memorabilia. “Prior to the evening, nearly everyone believed the luxury segment would outperform the art on offer. To everyone’s surprise fine art achieved very solid results, indicating a strong appetite for Saudi and Arab art,” says Rebecca Anne Proctor, the author of the book “Art in Saudi Arabia: A New Creative Economy?”who attended the sale. “While there were some beautiful pieces from the luxury segment, the sales were astonishingly few for a market that so prizes luxury.” While three works — by artists René Magritte, Fernando Botero and Banksy — sold for more than $1million, they were within estimate. The strongest sales were of Arab art, with two artist records set: $900,000 forThen What??(1965) by the Syrian artist Louay Kayyali and $264,000 for the Saudi Arabian artist Abdulhalim Radwi’sUntitled(1984). All four works by Saudi Arabian artists in the auction sold for above estimate and Samia Halaby’sBlue Trap (in a Railroad Station)(1977) realized $384,000, almost double its high estimate. “The results that we have achieved here during our inaugural sale is a clear signal of the depth of appetite that exists for art, and the thirst that is ready to be unlocked, of which tonight was a successful next step,” said Ashkan Baghestani, a Sotheby’s head of sale for fine art, in a statement.

            "China has unveiled sweeping new regulations to tighten the release of information about its military online, a move that could obscure key sources for monitoring the world’s largest armed forces. Therules, announced over the weekend and taking effect on March 1, come as China is rapidly building up and modernizing its People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to match the military might of the United States. It also marks the latest effort in leader Xi Jinping’sfar-reaching campaignto bolster national security and guard state secrets in the face of heightened geopolitical tensions. The all-encompassing rules could have a big impact on Chinese military bloggers and commentators, who are often quick to share images or information about new weapons systems, personnel appointments and troop movements. Such publicly available information posted by Chinese military enthusiasts has also been an important source for PLA watchers to track the development and movement of the Chinese military. The regulations are aimed at addressing issues including “the spread of false military information” and “the leakage of military secrets” on the internet, according toa Q&Areleased by the government. They lay out strict rules for online content about military affairs, banning the “producing, copying, publishing and disseminating” of military secrets, national defense technology and industry secrets or other undisclosed information. The banned list covers everything from the development and testing of weapons systems to military drills and deployment, as well as the organizational structures, tasks and combat capabilities of military units that have not been officially disclosed. The regulations target individual users and “online military information service providers,” which include dedicated military affairs websites, military columns and social media accounts focused on the military. In a sign of their sweeping scope, the regulations were issued jointly by 10 government and ruling Communist Party departments, from the top internet regulator and top military commanding body to the ministries of public security, state security and culture and tourism. Open source information has provided key clues about China’s military progress in the past. Last December,online footage and imagesof what many believed to be China’s next-generation stealth fighter jet caused a huge stir in both China and the overseas PLA watching community, after the mysterious aircraft were seen flying in broad daylight over two Chinese cities. It’s unclear how the new rules will affect foreign media reporting on the Chinese military. Analysts said the new regulations could portend a tightening of control over military-themed content on the Chinese internet. “Military and defense-related content enjoys significant popularity among Chinese internet users, but the leadership is clearly keen to ensure that sensitive information — a concept broadly applied in China — and speculation do not undermine the official narrative around the country’s military development and capabilities,”wroteDavid Bandurski, executive director of the China Media Project. James Char, a PLA expert and assistant professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said information related to the PLA and other military matters have long been placed under strict supervision by Chinese authorities. Some of the content banned by the new rules had already been outlawed in previous legislations, such as anything that harms national sovereignty and security or denigrate the military and its “heroes and martyrs.” Others are routinely censored on Chinese social media, such as comments criticizing China’s national defense policy and military strategy, or those spreading false information about the military. “I regard the announcement of these regulations as nothing more than the institutionalization of existing rules,” Char said. But he noted that the new rules banning the sharing of information on military deployments and troop movements do serve to outlaw such practices by internet users without PLA approval, such as military bloggers or the man on the street in China. “This may have an effect on these individuals’ readiness to post such material online the next time they come across troop movements or a military exercise in their localities,” Char said. “This will also work in Beijing’s interest in preventing its troop deployments within the mainland from being exposed in advance of another major military exercise or troop build-up in China’s coastal regions off the Taiwan Strait.”\n",
            "Leaders of Eastern and Southern African regional blocs met for an unprecedented joint summit on Saturday to find a solution to a conflict in eastern Congo, where Rwandan-backed rebels’ rapid advance since January has fanned fears of a wider war. The M23 rebels last weekcaptured Goma,the largest city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo - the worst escalation of fighting in more than a decade that has left thousands dead. Despite announcing a unilateral ceasefire, they have continued to march southtowards the city of Bukavu. Presidents, including Rwanda’s Paul Kagame, lined up on stage at the start of talks in Dar es Salaam. Congo’s Felix Tshisekedi attended via video link. “History will judge us harshly if we remain still and watch the situation worsen, day by day,” Tanzania’s President Samia Suluhu Hassan said at the opening ceremony. The first-ever summit of both Eastern and Southern African blocs points to the continent’s deep concern over the crisis and the standoff between Congo and neighboring Rwanda, which denies allegations it is fueling the conflict with its own troops and weapons. The two groupings have, so far, been broadly divided over the conflict, with the eastern bloc closer to Rwanda’s call for dialogue and southern countries backing Congo and angry over the deaths of peacekeepers, experts and diplomats said. The leaders are seeking a breakthrough after two peace processes in Luanda and Nairobi stalled as tensions escalated. The blocs’ foreign ministers have recommended the summit consider calling for the cessation of hostilities, an unconditional ceasefire, and the reopening of Goma airport and other key routes for the delivery of urgently needed humanitarian aid. Over the past month, M23’s lightning advances have expanded its control over North Kivu province’s lucrative coltan, gold and tin ore mines, uprooting thousands in what was already one of the world’s most dire humanitarian crises. Aid groups have been helping to relieve overwhelmed hospitals as health workersrace against timeto bury the bodies of at least 2,000 people killed in the battle for Goma, amid concerns of disease spreading. Prosecutors at the International Criminal Court say they areclosely monitoringthe bloodshed, where reports are emerging of rape,gang rapeand sexual slavery, according to the U.N. human rights office. Ahead of the summit, the United States warned ofpossible sanctions againstRwandan and Congolese officials, further raising the stakes for finding a solution to a conflict that is rooted in the long fallout from the 1994 Rwandan genocide and the struggle for control of Congo’s mineral resources. Well-trained and professionally armed, M23 is the latest in a long line of ethnic Tutsi-led rebel movements to emerge in Congo’s volatile east. Congo’s government says it is a Rwandan proxy, which the rebel group denies. Rwanda rejects accusations that thousands of its troops are fighting alongside M23. But it says it is defending itself against the threat from a Hutu-led militia, which it says is fighting alongside the Congolese military.\n",
            "“Hello from Free Syria. I’m in Damascus right now. It’s a beautiful winter. Everything is better than before,” Ayoub Alsmadi, founder ofSyria Scope Travel, told CNN Travel. “Everyone is super-optimistic since the fall of Assad’s regime.” On December 8, 2024, Damascus fell to Syrian rebels. As Bashar al-Assad’s regime crumbled, the dictator’s 24-year-long reign came to an ignominious end when he fled to Moscow. Now, the green, white and black flag of “Free Syria” flies above Damascus, and local operators like Alsmadi hope to revitalize Syria’s devastated tourist industry. For the first time since 2011, when Syria was plunged into a decades-long civil war claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians, international airlines includingQatar AirwaysandTurkish Airlineshave resumed operations in Damascus. Although multiple governments advise their citizens not to visit Syria — theUS Department of Stateadvises against travel “due to the risk of terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping or hostage-taking, and armed conflict,” while the United Kingdom’sForeign and Commonwealth Development Officestates “If you are a British national in Syria, leave the country by any practical means” — adventure travel companies are scheduling tours over the coming months. Just six weeks after rebels ousted Assad, Alsmadi welcomed his first tourists at the Lebanese-Syrian border in mid-January. “Right now, because of the war, every single person in the world knows about Syria,” he said from Damascus. “Now Assad is gone I’m sure the tourism industry will grow so fast. And as soon as governments stop saying ‘Don’t go to Syria,’ tourism will explode.” “In 2010, more than 10 million tourists visited Syria,” said James Wilcox, founder ofUntamed Borders, a company specialising in extreme destinations which have timetabled their first Syrian tour since the fall of Assad’s regime for April 2025. “Tourism is an incredibly powerful tool to help countries bounce back from years of war. It helps to create hope, particularly in a nation where many other industries were decimated during the conflict.” Before the civil war, tourismreportedly accounted for 14% of Syria’s GDP. With a history stretching back to antiquity, tourists were drawn to ancient sites like Palmyra, a Greco-Roman city largely destroyed by ISIS and desert landscapes dotted with Crusader-era castles like Krak des Chevaliers. Damascus is one of the world’s oldest continuously inhabited cities, while the verdant Mediterranean coastline, once famed for its sun-drenched beach resorts, teems with turquoise waters and sandy bays. Adnan Habbab, director ofNawafir Travel and Tours, openedBeit Zafran Hotel de Charmin a converted, Ottoman-era house dating to 1836 in Damascus’UNESCO World Heritage-listed Old Cityin 2010. As tourism boomed in pre-conflict Syria, Habbab’s rooms were fully booked. A year later, he locked his hotel’s historic wooden doors when war erupted. They remained shuttered until 2017 when conflict lines stabilized. Although the Assad regime tentatively resumed tourism in 2017, Habbab said the government-controled itineraries, secret police-tailed tour groups and guides deviating from the party line could be thrown in jail. “Whenever I brought tourists to Syria I had the secret service in my office, asking who are they?” Habbab said from his office in Amman, Jordan, where he relocated during the conflict. “Where did they go? What did they do? What did they eat? Who did they talk to? The Assad regime assumed all tourists were spies until they proved otherwise. It was a challenging time to work in tourism.” Despite these challenges, a desire to rebuild Syria’s tourism industry never waned. Alsmadi, who grew up in Damascus during the civil war and saw his family home destroyed in the fighting, graduated from Damascus University with a degree in Tourism Management in 2019. “Tourism is always the first thing affected by war and the last to recover,” said Alsmadi. “But tourism is my passion. I’m curious about history, I love languages, and I’m glad I stayed in Syria. I want to help tourism recover.” Alsmadi was certain things would change when he founded Syria Scope Travel in 2019. Now, as his tour-guiding calendar is fast filling up, he believes that time has arrived. Habbab, who has reopened his hotel’s doors and is organizing tours for spring 2025, agrees. “The fact is that tourists who come to Syria can talk and walk freely now,” he said. “Syrians are trying to collect themselves, shops and businesses are reopening. I’m very optimistic the future will be much brighter than the last 53 years of darkness under the Assads.” Travelers planning potential trips to Syria will not only be concerned with safety but may question the ethics of visiting a nation consumed, until very recently, by conflict. The interim government consists of a coalition of rebel groups led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which theUnited Kingdom’s Foreign Secretary describedas a “terrorist organisation” and an “alias of Al-Qaida.” Former members of the Assad regime are still being hunted down across Syria, and theRed Crossestimates that 90% of Syrians live in poverty and 76% of Syrians face food shortages thanks to years of war and international sanctions. International tour operators CNN Travel spoke to are hopeful for a quick revival though. Dylan Harris, founder of the British tour company Lupine Travel, had just returned from a 10-day safety assessment in Syria ahead ofupcoming tours scheduled in May. “As things stand in the areas we’re visiting, it’s the safest it’s been for 14 years,” said Harris. “We’re aware it’s still very early days and the situation can change quickly. The country is stable, currently, but it will become clearer in March/April when the transitional government has been in power for a few months. “The hope is they’re willing to power share and create an inclusive coalition to draft a new constitution and prepare for elections. If HTS decides to go the opposite way though, the outlook is bleak and the risk of returning to years more civil war is high.” Wilcox of Untamed Borders said the current levels of “relative stability” are promising, but different groups in Syria will want a say in how the country moves forward. Wilcox, who has years of experience organising tours to former conflict zones, including Somalia and Chechnya, said his company will draw on this experience when it re-launches its Syrian tours to “reduce risk to what we believe is an acceptable level.” Tour operators like Lupine and Untamed Borders say they’ll utilize experienced local operators and a network of local contacts to stay informed of potentially fast-moving events and mitigate risks for their guests. Harris from Lupine Travel said that despite years of conflict and robust travel warnings, Syria could reboot its tourism industry quickly. “The infrastructure is there. Most of the tourist sites emerged relatively unscathed from the civil war and lots of hotels survived,” he said. “Many guides and drivers are all still there — they kept themselves busy, becoming media fixers during the war.” Habbab explained how before the war, tourists were primarily history enthusiasts. When tourism resumed in 2017, he largely organised trips for dark tourists wanting a peek inside the Assad regime, a trend he said will continue. Itineraries for 2025 already include the liberatedSaydnaya Prison, where Assad’s regime tortured and executed political prisoners, and cities like Aleppo and Homs which were all but destroyed. Hababb believes visits to sites like these can have a positive impact in recognizing and remembering the regime’s crimes while helping the world better understand the Syrian refugee crisis which, theUN Refugee Agency estimates,forced 14 million Syrians from their homes. “We need to turn the prisons where they tortured and killed people into museums,” said Habbab. “It’s something we should never forget. It will help people understand that when Syrians took boats to Europe or fled to North America, they had a reason to do so. They had something to fear.” Likewise, Alsmadi wants tourists to visit sites like Palmyra, which he said holds the history of Syria within its devastated ruins. “Tourists will want to know about the war,” he told CNN Travel. “That’s why I take people to Palmyra. ISIS destroyed the temples in 2014, but now they’re being rebuilt. Palmyra is the story of Syria.” Tour operators also point out how, if Syria remains stable, a revitalized tourism industry can help the nation reforge international ties and rebuild its economy. “It’s completely understandable for people to have concerns about travelling to Syria given its recent history,” said Shane Horan, founder ofRocky Road Travel, who specialize in destinations like Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen. They’ve organized a private Syrian tour for February and are launching group trips in April. “However, we encourage them to see tourism as part of the country’s healing process. Visiting Syria now provides a unique opportunity to witness its resilience and contribute directly to its recovery.” Gareth Johnson, co-founder ofYoung Pioneers Tours, sees tourism as a force for good in post-conflict nations. His company has planned tours coinciding with cultural events, including the Marmarita Carnival, a Christian festival celebrated in August. “Like any country we go to, people-to-people exchanges benefit people,” said Johnson. “Let’s not forget that Syria has been one of the most sanctioned countries on earth, so tourism will not just bring understanding, but also jobs, money and a trickle-down economy benefiting everyone. These are things that the local people are not just craving, but truly deserve.” Habbab told CNN Travel that for the first time in decades, Syrians have hope, and he wants the world to share in that. “Come to Syria and you’re witnessing history. The country is like a festival right now,” he said happily. “The millions of tourists who visited us before, I’m sure they’d love to return. If you want to visit, you’re welcome. You can support the Syrian people, the economy, encourage hotels and businesses to reopen, and share our happiness.”\n",
            "Former Spanish football federation chiefLuis Rubialessaid Tuesday that he asked Women’sWorld Cup winnerJennifer Hermoso for permission before kissing her during the on-field medal ceremony for Spain’s victory in 2023. During testimony at his sexual assault trial in Madrid, Rubiales said he asked Hermoso if he could kiss her prior to the incident. Hermoso, 34, has said that Rubiales did not have consent to kiss her. Rubiales is charged with one count of sexual assault and one count of coercion for the August 2023 kiss. Prosecutors are seeking a two-and-a-half year prison sentence for Rubiales. On Tuesday, Rubiales said he got carried away in the moment. “It is not this common to win a World Cup… I made a mistake and put my foot in my mouth,” Rubiales told the court. “I behaved like an athlete who achieves success,” Rubiales said, adding: “I should have acted cold-blooded and played a more institutional role.” Hermoso, who spoke at the trial earlier this month, said that the kiss “tainted one of the happiest days of my life.” “I knew I was being kissed by my boss and that should not happen in any social or work environment,” she said. “Until today it seems that my life has been on standby, honestly I have not lived freely,” Hermoso said. The kiss was captured on camera during the medal presentation ceremony, and went viral on social media. Protests followed in a number of Spanish cities, with demonstrators seeking to highlight the continued prevalence of a culture of misogyny in sport, as well as in wider Spanish society. In response, Rubiales, 47, said that the kiss had been “mutual.” Hermoso has always denied that this is the case. On February 3, Hermoso testified that Rubiales had pressured her to make a statement downplaying the incident amid a public backlash against him. “I told him no, that I wasn’t going to do anything,” Hermoso said. “I told him I was sorry, but I wasn’t going to do it.” On Tuesday, a lip-reading expert called to testify by Rubiales’ legal team told the court that two video clips of the incident showed Rubiales asking Hermoso: “Can I give you a little kiss?” The expert said that they were unable to see Hermoso’s reaction as the video showed her from behind.

            "Israeli police raided two Palestinian bookstores inoccupied east Jerusalemon Sunday, confiscating books and arresting one of the owners and his nephew, according to their family members. CCTV footage shared by the owners, four brothers from the Muna family, shows police officers putting books in trash bags at one of the branches of the Educational Bookshop, a decades-old respected institution with Arabic- and English-language branches. “They did throw some books on the ground but the Arabic (language) store is where the material damage was,” store owner Iyad Muna told CNN. Photos shared by Muna of the Arabic-language store show books, notebooks and writing materials scattered on the ground. Israeli police said in a statement Monday that two people were arrested on suspicion of “selling books containing incitement and support for terrorism.” “The suspects who allegedly sold the books were taken into custody by police detectives,” the police spokesperson’s unit said. An Israeli court on Monday extended the detention of the two men – Mahmoud and Ahmed Muna – by 24 hours, to be followed by five days of house arrest. Their family said Tuesday that the pair had indeed been released to house arrest. Police had originally asked for their detention to be extended for eight days while the investigation continued. The pair’s lawyer, Nasser Odeh, told CNN on Monday that he was “surprised” by the Israeli police’s request for an extension of the men’s detention. “During the proceedings, we legally argued that this search order was not based on solid grounds,” he said. “We also argued that the books in question discuss Palestinian history, human rights and the suffering experienced by the Palestinian people and various communities. Moreover, we asserted that these books do not pose any threat or danger and do not support the allegations made against them,” Odeh continued. Representatives of diplomatic missions from the European Union, several EU member states, the United Kingdom and Brazil were present in court ahead of the hearing, according to a CNN journalist present. Israeli police said that “detectives encountered numerous books containing inciteful material with nationalist Palestinian themes” in the stores. Among them was a children’s coloring book titled “From the River to the Sea.” The expression is politically controversial in Israel. Some Palestinians use the phrase in support of a homeland between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean, but many Jews regard it as a call for Israel’s destruction. Established in 1984 on the central Salah el Dein street, the Educational Bookshop has since expanded and has become one of the most well-known cultural institutions in East Jerusalem. The original branch sells Arabic books, while the English-language store opened years later is frequented by Palestinians, Israelis and foreigners alike. A third shop, located inside the American Colony Hotel, is popular with diplomats, reporters and foreign dignitaries staying at the historic hotel. The bookshop was founded by Ahmad Muna, a Jerusalemite who worked as a teacher in the Shu’fat refugee camp on the outskirts of the city. According to his son Mahmoud, who now runs the bookshop and was arrested on Sunday, Ahmad would usually spend the morning teaching and then open the shop in the afternoons and evenings. The shop sells books about Palestinian history, the Arab-Israeli conflict and Jerusalem, as well as contemporary Palestinian fiction, art books, Palestinian cookbooks, reprints of historical maps and art prints. The group “The Time Has Come,” which lobbies for peace between Jews and Palestinians, said the bookstore and its people “are an important part of the shared future we envision for Jerusalem. The arrest and confiscation not only harm the right to free expression and the freedom of information but also place the city’s future on the brink.” Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur for Palestinian Territories, said she was “shocked by the raid” on the bookstores, whichshe called“an intellectual lighthouse and family-run gem resisting Palestinian erasure under apartheid.” Albanese also urged the international community in Jerusalem to “show up, stand with the Muna family, and protect this vital hub.” This has been updated with additional developments. Correction: This article previously referred to “The Time Has Come” group as “Ad Kan.” The two groups are separate entities, and the comments in this article are those of “The Time Has Come.”\n",
            "Driving throughTashkentfeels like flipping through an architecture picture book teeming with examples of Soviet brutalist, orientalist, modernist, futurist and neoclassical styles. One marvel after another, buildings in Uzbekistan’s capital city whiz by like a carousel for design lovers. After an earthquake leveled much of its infrastructure in 1966, Tashkent became a laboratory of urbanism. Architects arrived en masse to rebuild roads, apartment blocks, hotels, theaters, shopping malls, metro stations and a panoply of public structures that offered different takes on progressive socialist living. Today, new landmarks designed by the firms of “starchitects” such as the lateZaha HadidandTadao Andoare in the works, as well as an “Olympic City” comprisingfive state-of-the-art sportsvenues  for the 2025 Asian Youth Olympic Games. Beyond the capital, the cities of Bukhara, Samarkand and Khiva contain an array of ancient “toki” (domed markets), “madrasa” (schools) and “caravanserai” (inns) built for traders who traversed the Silk Road. Now, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s government is pouring resources into highlighting this rich architectural legacy as part of a campaign to open the former USSR republic to the world. Conservation work on its historic sites is a top priority. “By preserving and restoring these unique architectural treasures, we position Uzbekistan as a global cultural destination,” said Gayane Umerova, chairperson of the Uzbekistan Art & Culture Development Foundation (ACDF) in a statement to CNN. The investment, she added, will be paid off “through increased tourism revenue, job creation, urban revitalization, and cultural branding, as well as preserving and reimagining our heritage in this new era.” Reimagining a collective identity is something of a preoccupation for a nation that only gained its independence from the USSR in 1991. Within Uzbekistan, where 60% of the population is under 30 years old, not everyone is particularly enamored with vestiges of its Soviet past. Young Uzbeks often opt to live in Western-style apartments and point to the gleaming towers in the international business district, including the sprawlingTashkent City Mall, as points of pride. Inevitably, generic glass-and-steel modernity sometimes buts against preservationists’ agendas. The demolition of the iconicDom Kino cinema house—  to make way for a business park — in 2017, in particular, spurred heritage advocates to action. Over the past three years, ACDF has held 10 exhibitions in 10 countries, including shows atParis’ Louvre Museumand theMilan Triennale. It has also convened conferences (one of which was headlined by celebrated Dutch architecture theorist Rem Koolhaas and anotherfeatured expertsfrom UNESCO, the Guggenheim, Venice Heritage and the British Council), developed a “Tashkent Modernism”app, and commissioned a meticulously researched900-page booktitled “Tashkent Modernism XX/XXI.” Getting influential voices outside of Uzbekistan to rally behind unloved local treasures has, historically, proven to be effective, according to Ekaterina Golovatyuk, a Milan-based architect, researcher and co-editor of “Tashkent Modernism.” “Nobody really cared about Soviet modernism until that book byFrédéric Chaubin,” she said, referring to the hugely popular coffee-table book “CCCP: Cosmic Communist Constructions,”a 2011 architectural survey of 14 former Soviet republics published by Taschen. French photographer Chaubin’s travelogue, she said, spurred architectural expeditions like Canadian photographer Christopher Herwig’s catalog of Soviet bus stops and Garage Museum’s Soviet modernism guidebook series. “People … started saying, ‘If somebody is traveling from so far away and actually covering it in such a regional way, that must mean something. We might have been underestimating the relevance of this,’” Golovatyuk added. Social media influencers who introduce their followers to Uzbekistan’s under-the-radar wonders are helping, too. “It gives visibility to this architecture and transforms it into some sort of cultural and artistic product — something that you don’t perceive when you walk past it every day in the city,” Golovatyuk said. Amid the current construction boom, Uzbekistan is again serving as a magnet for progressive building ideas, just as it did in the 1960s and 1970s. This time, however, the most consequential issue is sustainability. Wael Al Awar, the Lebanese architect co-curating the Uzbekistan’sinaugrual Bukhara Biennial, says the country’s ancient cities are teeming with green solutions. Buildings are responsible for almost40% of global carbon emissions, and Al Awar points to the “standardization and globalization in architecture” as a culprit, adding that contemporary concrete buildings have also resulted in a homogenization of the world’s skylines. “Uzbekistan’s structures, in contrast, are contextual,” he said “They’re made by local communities who know the weather and the climate, and respond to that when they build. This is something we’ve lost.” Most ancient buildings in Uzbekistan are naturally energy-efficient, according to Takhmina Turdialieva, co-founder of the Tashkent-based collective,Tatalab, referring to the historic public buildings and dwellings found in Uzbekistan’s Silk Road cities. “It’s very pleasant in the summer and (buildings stay) warm during the winter because of the choice of construction materials and well-designed air circulation. If we learn those passive design methods, we don’t need any new technologies to make buildings more sustainable,” she said. “Modern architecture in Uzbekistan should be based on traditional construction materials like brick and clay,” she added. “We can express different designs with those eco-friendly materials and keep traditions in mind. I think this is how we express modern Uzbek,” she says. Thisnew vision of modernityis taking shape inNew Tashkent City, a 20,000-hectare extension of Uzbekistan’s capital that posits to become a locus of sustainable design ideas. Zaha Hadid Architects’ winning design for the Alisher Navoi International Scientific Research Centre, for instance, uses locally made bricks to achieve the firm’s signature avant-garde swooping structures Turdialieva, who also leads the Young Architect’s Association of Uzbekistan, adds that a global spotlight on Uzbek design could help invigorate the country’s next generation of architects. “Maybe this will be a starting point when more attention will be paid to local architects so they can better develop their potential,” she said.\n",
            "Like an object floating upward yet still underwater, the bare, vague bones of a peace plan forUkraineare taking shape. Despite arelative silencein policy announcements on this war from an otherwise vocal Trump administration, the next two weeks may see significant route markers planted in public. Whether they gain any traction with the Kremlin remains unclear. Last week, US President Donald Trump officially appointed 80-year-old retired Gen. Keith Kellogg as his envoy to Ukraine and Russia. Almost Kellogg’s first act was to announce he would discuss their vision for peace in Ukraine with allies at the Munich Security Conference, on February 14-16. He is then expected, four days later, to visit Kyiv, for his first, long-anticipated trip there, according to Ukrainian state media. Kellogg’s every utterance is parsed by an anxious Kyiv. He hit back at suggestions that the Munich conference would see the outline of a peace plan revealed publicly, telling Newsmax: “The person who will present the peace plan is the president of the United States, not Keith Kellogg.” Trump will have the potential big reveal, it seems, after Kellogg consults with allies in Germany. Trump has tried to kickstart the process, it seems in recent days, telling The New York Post Saturday he had spoken to Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin about ending the war, but providing no details. The Kremlin declined to confirm that call, but spokesman Dmitri Peskov told CNN: “There could be something I don’t know.” You might expect a complex, diplomatic symphony to strike up to try and end the largest war in Europe since the 1940s. Instead, in public at least, a scrappy version of online karaoke has the players involved struggling to hold together the same tune. Trump has been surprisingly vocal about the need to end the conflict, but short of public ideas. He floated the idea of meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this week. Yet no date has been set, and Trump’s comments seemed an off-the-cuff response to a question about whether his ambitious Vice President JD Vance would meet Zelensky in Munich. In truth, we do not know how much is happening in private. The Kremlin has hinted at “intensified” discussions, and US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz has spoken of private efforts. Unusually, Kellogg’s blueprint for peace has been public since April, providing a stable frame of reference against which to compare any real details of a deal. In short, it involved Ukraine getting more military aid conditioned on negotiations, and a ceasefire, followed by possible European peacekeepers along the frontlines. Kellogg has also suggested an initial ceasefire might be time for elections in Ukraine, if any truce can take hold. A putative timetable for any deal appeared in Ukrainian media this week, suggesting a ceasefire around Easter in late April, a peace conference and wider deal in May, but only presidential elections for the country in August. This was also flatly rejected as fake by the presidency. But the leaks, confected or not, will keep coming, as all sides try to float or reject ideas. It is hard to not interpret a call for elections as a way to have Zelensky slowly step aside, and perhaps offer a sweetener to get the Kremlin to the table. The Ukrainian leader’s animosity is insurmountable toward Putin, whose invasion has laid waste to swathes of Ukraine and allegedly committed war crimes against its citizens. Zelensky and the US president also had a fraught relationship during his first term overTrump’s demand to investigate the Biden family. Zelensky is now entering a phase where the two most powerful voices in any peace deal don’t share the widespread adulation he has enjoyed from the West for three years. Talk of elections has sparked unchecked speculation around Kyiv about Zelensky’s future. He has given lengthy interviews in the past week, appearing at times angry and anxious that Ukraine might not be front and center of any talks. In his daily address Thursday he was “sure” there was no official peace plan “yet.” He added: “What is in certain publications, again, I’m sure, maybe I’m wrong, but I’m sure that this is not an official plan of President Trump.” His senior staff have spoken to Kellogg and Waltz in recent days, they have said. But Zelensky is no longer an insurmountable figure. Leading some polls, in any future Ukrainianpresidential election, is Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the military chief Zelensky fired last year. Zalyuzhnii is currently the Ukrainian ambassador to the United Kingdom, and was pictured recently meeting the British Foreign Secretary David Lammy in Kyiv. Elections in Ukraine are currently delayed as part of martial law, the valid argument for that being that the country – under constant bombardment, with millions of its people physically at war or refugees abroad, and fending off an aggressive neighbor who has vigorously meddled in its votes for two decades – can’t have a free and fair election until there is peace. But an initial ceasefire might provide that calm, and even a chance for Zelensky to step back and provide an opportunity for a fresh face, without the uncomfortable history Ukraine’s current leader has with Trump’s first term, to negotiate a wider deal. Zalzyuzhnii could command the loyalty of Ukraine’s armed forces into a less-than perfect accommodation with Moscow. But a lot could also go very wrong. Electoral chaos might engender an imperfect or challenged result. More pro-Russian sentiment might make its way onto the ballot, through hacking, or malfeasance. The threat of corruption investigations is leaving many officials concerned about their own fate. It is the sort of mess you would expect in wartime, and why elections could be one complexity too far. This conflict has defined itself as one of the unexpected. Zelensky has been likened to a modern Winston Churchill, providing the West the spine it did not know it needed. It would be in keeping with the war’s wild vacillations that he steps aside at Ukraine’s moment of greatest vulnerability. Another hurdle for peace is whether the Kremlin wants it now, or at all. They are currently winning on the battlefield – not at pace, but they are taking ground. Russian forces appear to have taken the city of Toretsk and may soon capture Pokrovsk, deeper into Ukraine’s Donetsk region. This would also leave them with relatively open ground all the way to the key cities of Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia. It is unclear why Russia would seek to freeze its frontline progress when Ukraine, in the words of one frontline soldier to CNN, “doesn’t have much to say about it.” This week will see fragments of the private – or spontaneously imagined – plan for peace emerge into the public domain. Each nuance effects the lives of millions of Ukrainians and dictates security in Europe for decades. Even Taiwan is safer if Russia is not emboldened. They can only hope, as the silhouette of a plan drifts toward the surface, that it is as serious as the moment.\n",
            "Two rare black wolves, likely siblings, were spotted on camera crossing a stream in aPolishforest, a conservation organization said Sunday. The unusual sighting, captured last year on a video camera set up by SAVE Wildlife Conservation Fund Poland project coordinator Joanna Toczydłowska, has prompted the organization to collect scat (droppings) in the forest in the hopes of learning more about the black wolves’ genetics. “It’s something new and unusual,” Toczydłowska told The Associated Press. Toczydłowska initially placed the camera to study beavers. When she noticed she was recording wolves instead, she kept the camera there and collected the black wolf footage a few weeks ago. In one clip, a black wolf and a gray wolf slowly crossed a stream in the forest, the water nearly up to their bellies, before they leap onto the bank. A second clip, taken last fall, records two black wolves and a gray wolf fording the same stream. Most of the 2,500 to 3,000 wolves in Poland are gray with red or black accents. Black fur comes from a genetic mutation that was likely in domesticated dogs thousands of years ago. The dark fur is rare in Europe due to a reduced genetic diversity, but at least half of the wolf population has black fur in Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Because wolves travel in families and both black wolves were around 30 kilograms (66 lbs) — roughly the size of a German shepherd — Toczydłowska said they were likely siblings and roughly a year old. At least one is male. The conservation organization, which has been monitoring wolves in Poland for 13 years, is not disclosing the forest’s location to keep the wolves safe from poaching and prevent misinformation about wolves from spreading. Wolves were essentially extinct in Poland by the 1950s, but the population has returned in recent years, especially in central part of the country in the early 2000s. Toczydłowska and her colleagues teach other the public how to safely live in areas inhabited by wolfpacks. “For people, it is a new phenomenon,” Roman Gula, head of the organization’s wolf monitoring project, told the AP. “Education is one of our major, major goals.” The conservation fund announced the sighting last week on Facebook and asked for financial support to pay for the scat’s genetic testing to learn more about the black-fur mutation.\n",
            "Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD has added an advanced driver-assistance system for most of its models at no additional cost, catapulting its shares to a record high. Chinese customers can now experience the carmaker’s proprietary “God’s Eye” driver-assistance system in models that cost as little as 69,800 yuan ($9,555). Analysts said the move could further fuel a brutal, ongoing price war in the world’s biggest car market. Shares of BYD surged more than 4% to a record high, according to Refinitiv data, when trading in Hong Kong began on Tuesday. Its shares were last trading at 330 Hong Kong dollars ($42). “2025 will be the first year of intelligent driving for all,” BYD Chairman Wang Chuanfu said inan eventfrom its headquarters in Shenzhen on Monday. Wang predicted that high-level intelligent driving will become an essential feature in automobiles, much like seat belts and airbags, within the next three years. Previously, the “God’s Eye” feature, introduced in 2023 to assist car navigation, was only offered in BYD models costing more than $30,000. BYD ranked sixth in global car sales, with China’s Geely Auto following in tenth, Wang said onstage, citing research from Cailianshe, a state-linked media firm. It also dominated the Chinese market, accounting for over 32% of total new energy vehicle sales in 2024, according toChina Passenger Car Association. Tu Le, founder and managing director of the consultancy Sino Auto Insights, said BYD’s move “puts their competitors on their heels” because of the affordable pricing. Tesla, BYD’s main rival, has released similar Full Self-Driving features in the US for a subscription fee of $99 a month or a one time payment of $8,000. It awaits regulatory approval to launch trials in the Chinese market. Tesla may need to rethink its subscription-based strategy when entering China, Le added. Besides Tesla, BYD’s announcement is expected to put pressure other Chinese competitors like Xpeng and Geely Auto, whose shares dropped on Tuesday. At Monday’s event, the company also announced its plan to integrate DeepSeek, the AI model from a Chinese startup that made global headlines last month with a high-performing chatbot that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT, into BYD cars. BYD is known for its aggressive pricing strategy. The price war, sparked by Tesla two years ago, has become so intense that BYDasked its supplierslate last year to deliver hefty price reductions of 10% for the coming year.\n",
            "Vilnius, Lithuania (REUTERS)– Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania said on Sunday they had successfully synchronized their electricity systems to the European continental power grid, one day after severing decades-oldenergy ties to Russiaand Belarus Planned for many years, the complex switch away from the grid of their former Soviet imperial overlord is designed to integrate the three Baltic nations more closely with the European Union and to boost the region’s energy security. “We did it!,” Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said in a post on social media X. After disconnecting on Saturday from the IPS/UPS network, established by the Soviet Union in the 1950s and now run by Russia, the Baltic nations cut cross-border high-voltage transmission lines in eastern Latvia, some 100 meters (328 feet) from the Russian border, handing out pieces of chopped wire to enthusiastic bystanders as keepsakes. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, herself an Estonian, earlier this week called the switch “a victory for freedom and European unity.” The Baltic Sea region is on high alert after power cable, telecom links and gas pipelineoutages between the Balticsand Sweden or Finland. All were believed to have been caused by ships dragging anchors along the seabed following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia has denied any involvement. Poland and the Baltics deployed navy assets, elite police units and helicopters after an undersea power link from Finland to Estonia was damaged in December, while Lithuania’s military began drills to protect the overland connection to Poland. Analysts say more damage to links could push power prices in the Baltics to levels not seen since the invasion of Ukraine, when energy prices soared. The IPS/UPS grid was the final remaining link to Russia for the three countries, which re-emerged as independent nations in the early 1990s at the fall of the Soviet Union, and joined the European Union and NATO in 2004. The three staunch supporters of Kyiv stopped purchases of power from Russia following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but have relied on the Russian grid to control frequencies and stabilize networks to avoid outages.\n",
            "Five Thai workers released after being held hostage for over a year in Gaza arrived in Bangkok on Sunday. Sarusak Rumnao, 32, Watchara Sriaoun, 33, Sathian Suwannakham, 35, Pongsak Thaenna, 36, and Bannawat Saethao, 27,were freedon January 30 as part of an exchange arrangement. They were embraced by family members, some of whom cried, in the arrivals hall at Suvarnabhumi Airport. Thai Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa and the Israeli Ambassador to Thailand Orna Sagiv were both at the airport to welcome home the freed hostages. “We are all very grateful and very happy that we get to return to our homeland. We all would really like to thank you. I don’t know what else to say,” Pongsak told a news conference at the airport. Maris said the Thai government “never gave up hope and here is the result today. The tears of joy are our encouragement.” He added that Bangkok would continue working to secure the release of the remaining Thai hostage. The group quickly left the news conference to return to their hometowns in Thailand’s northern and northeastern regions. They were the second batch of Thai hostages released since the war broke out. During an earlier ceasefire in November 2023,23 Thai nationals were releasedin a deal negotiated between Thailand and Hamas, with assistance from Qatar and Iran.\n",
            "DeepSeek’s advances have roiled global stock markets and AI players. Now, its influence is spreading quickly at home, with some of China’s biggest tech companies, many of which had been developing their own chatbots, racing to incorporate the open-source model into their own services. In early February telecoms giant Huawei said it would run DeepSeek on its own computing hardware composed of its Ascend computer processors, which are domestically produced. Some AI watchers have hailed this as a turning point, as it demonstrates that a high-performing model like DeepSeek no longer requires Nvidia’s most powerful chips to operate. “This partnership defies US sanctions by proving China can deliver globally competitive AI performance using domestically developed AI hardware and software stack, replacing Nvidia chips with Ascend chips,” analysts at Bernstein, an investment and research firm, wrote in a research note earlier this month. Startingin late 2022, the Biden Administration imposed several rounds of export controls on China in an effort to deprive the country of technology that Washington fears Beijing could use to make the next generation of weapons and AI systems. But the success of DeepSeek’s latest R1 AI model, which is said to be trained at a fraction of the cost of established players like ChatGPT, challenged the assumption that cutting off access to advanced chips could successfully stymie China’s progress. Such is DeepSeek’s fame that leading Chinese AI chipmakers — including Moore Threads, Tencent-backed Enflame, Baidu’s Kunlunxin and Hygon Information Technology — have also announced support for the firm, running the AI model on their own computing chips. Beyond chipmakers, the cloud arms of major Chinese technology companies have also rushed to incorporate DeepSeek’s technology into their offerings. Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, and TikTok parentBytedance announced they had made Deepseek’s service available through their cloud platforms. The country’s three major telecom operators, along with electronics maker Lenovo and auto brand Geely, have also adopted DeepSeek into their cloud platforms and products. “It serves as recognition for open-source large-model companies. If your model is good enough, AI giants will integrate it into their platforms,” said Lian Jye Su, chief analyst at Omdia, a technology research firm. These major Chinese tech firms, which have dominated the country’s internet scene for more than a decade, began rolling out their own large language models over the past two years since the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022. Despite having competing products they have welcomed DeepSeek. Su said the primary reason for their adoption is to attract more people and businesses to use their platforms. “In reality, making money directly from large models is difficult for AI giants — unless there are mature consumer and enterprise applications to support them,” he said. Their moves reflect a wider trend. American Big Tech — including Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon — have similarly embraced DeepSeek. Deepseek, the Hangzhou-based startup founded in 2023, sentshock wavesaround the world last month when it launched its newest AI model. Its AI Assistant app quickly topped global download charts, surpassing ChatGPT in late January. Within 20 days of launch, its daily active users have exceeded 22 million, according tostate media. Its success has catapulted its founder, Liang Wenfeng, into the ranks of national heroes. Despite the optimism, analysts caution that bottlenecks in China’s AI chip development remain due to US export restrictions. “Porting DeepSeek models to different chip architectures is a lot of low-level software work, and the fact they could do so quickly is amazing, but it doesn’t solve the chip shortage problem,” said Linghao Bao, senior analyst at Trivium China, a research and advisory firm. The ramp-up of advanced chip production continues to be hampered by the absence of advanced chipmaking equipment, which the US has banned from being exported to China, he said. And outside China, DeepSeek’s rapid rise has drawn scrutiny from various governments. Last week, Taiwan andAustraliabanned their government officials from using the Chinese AI service over data security risks. Some South Korean ministries and government departments have also issued bans. Last month, Italy imposed a blanket block on DeepSeek’s app after the company failed to address privacy concerns raised by the authorities. More countries have since raised concerns over the firm’s data practices.\n",
            "Scores ofunexploded bombsdating from World War II have been recovered from a children’s playground in northern England after a chance discovery. Local officials in the town of Wooler, Northumberland called in bomb disposal experts after workers involved in a planned overhaul of Scotts Play Park found unexploded ordnance, the parish council said in a statement sent to CNN on Monday. Two bombs were initially removed by the British Army, the UK Ministry of Defense said in a statement. The parish council was then advised that a full survey of the area was required, according to a council spokesperson. Bomb disposal company Brimstone Site Investigation then uncovered 65 10-pound practice bombs and smoke cartridges on the first day of works, with a further 90 practice bombs recovered on the second day. The company told CNN that the bombs date from World War II. According to the parish council, all of the bombs need to be found and removed before the park can be reopened. It said 174 devices had been found so far. “Whilst this ordnance is described as practice bombs, they do still carry a charge and given the numbers involved, need to be recovered by professionals to satisfy all concerned that the playpark area is once again safe for contractors and ultimately users of the equipment,” the council said in its statement. Local politician Mark Mather told the BBC that the area was reportedly used to train the Home Guard volunteer army during World War II, and it appeared that after the war the ordnance was buried. Further excavations will be carried out to make sure the playground is completely free from unexploded ordnance before new equipment is installed, the parish council added. In February 2024, thousands of residents were evacuated in Plymouth, southwest England, as authorities worked to remove an unexploded 500-kilogram (1,102-pound) bomb discovered in a garden in the city. This is not the only time that unexploded ordnance has been discovered in England recently. The bomb was moved before being disposed of at sea, after it was decided that detonating it in situ would have risked significant damage to nearby properties.\n",
            "Romania’s outgoing centrist president, Klaus Iohannis, resigned on Monday as opposition hard-right parliamentary parties planned to have him impeached. The European Union and NATO member state, which borders Ukraine, was plunged into institutional chaos last year when little-known far-right NATO critic Calin Georgescu won the first round of a presidential election. After accusations of Russian interference - denied by Moscow - Romania’s top courtvoidedthe entire election. With the two rounds of the election set to be re-run on May 4 and May 18, Romania’s top court had said Iohannis, whose second and last term expired on December 21, would stay on until his successor was elected. But in January, three far-right opposition parties, which control around 35% of parliament seats, filed a motion to impeach Iohannis. With the motion up for a vote, and Iohannis deeply unpopular, analysts have said some lawmakers from mainstream pro-European parties could give the hard-right’s impeachment effort the required majority. “The request will have consequences both domestically and abroad,” Iohannis told reporters. “To spare Romania this pointless and negative crisis… I am resigning from the president’s office.” Senate speaker Ilie Bolojan, head of the Liberal Party, a member of the ruling coalition, will take over as interim president with limited powers until the election. The three hard-right groupings, whose support has risen since Georgescu’s surprise win, had used their campaign against Iohannis as a reason to stage protests and seize the political agenda.\n",
            "The so-called land question has been a decades-long dilemma for South Africa. Apartheid,dismantled in the 1990s, left a deep-seededlegacy of land inequalityafter centuries of policies pushed non-White South Africans off the land to the benefit of White people. An act in 1913 limited Black ownership to just 7% of the land, later revised to 13%. Now, more than 100 years later, Black people make up 81% of South Africa’s population of 63 million, yet only own 4% of private land, according to a government land audit conducted in 2017. A long-debated expropriation act signed by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa last month seeks to right some of the wrongs of apartheid by allowing the government to take land and redistribute it. In some circumstances, expropriation is allowed without compensation, but only where it is “just and equitable and in the public interest.” However, no seizures of private property have taken place. Emphasizing “the public interest” and that land redistribution cannot be arbitrary, proponents say the legislation is necessary. In many parts of the countryside, vast expanses of land are owned by White farmers, while Black and non-White families have been pushed out into crowded townships, as CNNpreviously reported. But the controversial law has brought some of South Africa’s long-standing racial tensions and inequalities to the forefront, and now it’s beenseized onby United States President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, who claim it discriminates against White farmers. Musk, born in South Africa and now tasked withslashing US public spending, has accused Ramaphosa’s coalition government, led by the African National Congress (ANC) party, of having “openly racist ownership laws.” Musk’s stance has been denounced by some White South Africans. Bloemfontein resident David Van Wyk accused the billionaire of “cozying up to the extreme right-wing in the country,” which he described as “defenders of White privilege.” Van Wyk, 66, whose family owns mango and maize farms that export overseas, told CNN that Trump was “completely ignorant” about the inequalities in South Africa. “For Trump to create the impression that White people in South Africa are victims is nonsense. We (White South Africans) have incomes 10 to 20 times higher than the majority of (Black) people in South Africa,” he said, adding that “the majority of South African Black people still own nothing in the country of their ancestors.” Van Wyk said the Expropriation Act was driven by the need to address land inequalities in the country. Others, however, argue that the legislation attempts to do so “in a very clumsy manner,” according to Henk Smith, an attorney at a community-based organization, the Land Access Movement of South Africa (LAMOSA). Smith told CNN that in his view there must be a “just and equitable compensation” for every expropriated land except those reclaimed from mining companies that abuse their licenses, and state-owned enterprises not using their land productively. In anexecutive orderissued Friday, Trumprevoked all aid for South Africa, saying the purpose was to hit back at their government’s “actions fueling disproportionate violence against racially disfavored landowners,” namely White Afrikaners. He also used the order to condemn the country’sstance against Israeland its war in Gaza. Trump’s order specified that the US “shall not provide aid or assistance to South Africa” through the US Agency for International Development (USAID) or any other executive department or agency. That means the $440 million that South Africa receives in USassistance- most going to the health sector - was immediately halted. Trump suspended nearly all US foreign aid on his first day in office, and he has taken steps todismantle USAID, which means that many South African charities, health programs and HIV clinics have already taken a hit. “We are concerned about the potential impact of the decision by the United States government to suspend some of its funding for HIV and TB (tuberculosis) programs in African countries for 90 days. Now this funding that we get accounts for about 17% of our country’s HIV spend,” Ramaphosa told lawmakers Thursday, before the executive order, when further cuts to aid were only athreat. “We will not be deterred. We are, as South Africans, a resilient people, and we will not be bullied,” Ramaphosa said. Days later, he scrambled to send a delegation to Washington to negotiate with the Trump administration before the war of words went any further. It’s what’s not explicitly stated in the executive order that is worrying many South Africans. Fears are mounting that the Trump administration could remove the country’s eligibility from the African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA), a trade act that enhances market access to the US for qualifying Sub-Saharan African nations. Removal from the trade act, which is up for renewal this year, would be a serious blow to South Africa’s agricultural industry, especially citrus farmers, and the automotive industry. A spokesperson for South Africa’s Department of International Affairs has said that the misrepresentation of the land act “fuels unwarranted fears” about the targeting of White citizens. AgriSA, a trade organization for South African farmers, has also denounced claims of land seizures as “disinformation.” “The unexpected signing of the Expropriation Act on 23 January 2025 has sparked political turmoil and unnecessary tension within the agri-food system. This has been exacerbated by disinformation regarding the Act’s intent, impacting negatively on the investment climate for South African agriculture,” AgriSA chief executive Johann Kotzé said. “To be clear no seizures or confiscations of private property have taken place. Nor has any land been expropriated without compensation. Isolated cases of land grabs and trespassing have been dealt with,” Kotzé added. Meanwhile, the Solidarity Movement, a network of Afrikaner community institutions that says it represents about 600,000 members, has said it condemns “the many race laws that make us second class citizens,” including the Expropriation Act and is critical of the ANC’s foreign policy. But it doesn’t believe land grabs are taking place. “We want to put on record the following: We did not accuse the government of large-scale race-based land grabs, or distribute false information in this regard,” the movement said in a statement. “We did not and will not ask for sanctions against South Africa, or that funds for vulnerable people be cut off by the US government.” Nonetheless, Kallie Kriel, the leader of right-wing lobbying group AfriForum, which is part of the Solidarity Movement, said that Trump was correct to claim certain sectors of South African society are being treated “very badly.” “I think that is true even though people might deny it,” Kriel told Reuters. For years, AfriForum has claimed, against evidence, that there is possible ethnic cleansing and a “large-scale killing” of White farmers. Their interview with Fox News attracted atweet from Trump in 2018, when he first weighed in on the issue. But the Institute of Security Studies (ISS), an African research group,previously told CNNthat South Africa doesn’t have a farm murder problem, it has a wider murder problem. Themurder ratehas been steadily increasing since 2011, andviolent crimeaffects all parts of society.\n",
            "At least 31 suspectedMaoist rebelsand two police officials were killed on Sunday in the deadliest combat so far this year in centralIndia, police said. Hundreds of police and paramilitary soldiers launched an operation in the forests of the Indravati area of Chhattisgarh state based on intelligence that large number of rebels had gathered there, said state police Inspector General Pattilingam Sundarraj. Sundarraj said as the troops conducted a search operation fighting erupted in the forest, killing at least 31 insurgents and two police officials. Two other police were injured. He said search operations were continuing in the area and the troops had recovered some arms and ammunition, including automatic rifles. There was no immediate statement from the rebels. Sunday’s fighting is the biggest so far this year and the second major clash in less than a month in Chhattisgarh, according to police officer Jitendra Yadav. At least 16 rebels were killed in the state’s Gariband district on Jan. 23. According to Indian officials, the government had issued a bounty for 12 of them totaling about $345,000. Eight rebels were killed in a gunbattle with troops in the Bijapur district on Jan. 31. Indian soldiers have been battling the Maoist rebels across several central and northern states since 1967, when the militants, also known as Naxalites, began fighting to demand more jobs, land and wealth from natural resources for the country’s poor indigenous communities. The insurgents are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong. Years of neglect have isolated many locals, who face a lack of jobs, schools and health care clinics, making them open to overtures by the rebels. The rebels speak the same tribal languages as many villagers and have promised to fight for a better future especially in Chhattisgarh, one of India’s poorest states despite its vast mineral riches. The rebels have ambushed police, destroyed government offices and abducted officials. They’ve also blown up train tracks, attacked prisons to free their comrades and stolen weapons from police and paramilitary warehouses to arm themselves.\n",
            "The past year has seen the opening of the world’ssecond-tallest skyscraper, the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral and the announcement of countless futuristic urban mega-projects. Yet, the architecture world has, increasingly, recognized the value of altogether humbler pursuits. In March, the industry’s most prestigious accolade, the Pritzker Prize, was unexpectedly awarded to Japanese housing pioneerRiken Yamamoto,while asmall schoolin suburban Australia was later named the best new building at the World Architecture Festival. So, while 2025 will, as ever, be one that celebrates grand infrastructure projects and feats of engineering, smaller-scale designs — and those with genuine environmental credentials — may also find themselves in the global spotlight. From innovative timber buildings to one of Asia’s largest new airports, here are 11 projects opening in the next 12 months. The world’s third largest fish market is getting even bigger. More than eight years after the New South Wales government announced the relocation of Sydney’s historic fish market — which dates to the 1870s but has been on its current site since 1966 — the gleaming new four-floor building is opening on an adjacent 3.6-hectare site. Designed by 3XN Architects and Australian firm BVN (whichpromisesvisitors a “multi-sensory fish market experience”), the reimagined facility balances tourist infrastructure with the functional realities of a working wholesale market. Logistics and operations are hidden away in the basement, while the upper floors contain a market hall for visitors and an auction hall where restaurateurs and retailers bid on fresh catches as they arrive via pontoons. The project will also help rejuvenate an industrial part of the harbor with shops, restaurants, a promenade and an urban park, while the distinctive undulating roof is topped with 350 triangular solar panels. From April to October, Japan’s second cityOsaka plans to welcome an estimated 28 million visitors to Expo 2025, which will see around 40 countries build custom pavilions on site. The centerpiece, however, is the venue itself: The Grand Ring, a continuous circular wooden structure, more than 1.2 miles in circumference, that will take visitors around the vast site. Expo venues can serve as an expression of their host’s design ethos. When Osaka first hosted the Expo, in 1970, it erected a huge space-frame roof by the mostcelebrated avant-garde Japanese architectsof the time. So, in an age where timber buildings offer an alternative to carbon-intensive concrete, it seems fitting that the Grand Ring’s creator Sou Fujimoto is presenting a distinctly Japanese take on the global trend. Using local cedar and cypress wood (as well as Scottish pine), the architect’s vision combines modern construction methods with the wooden joints traditionally used in Japanese temples and shrines. At almost 646,000 square feet, it will be among the world’s largest wooden buildings. Although intended to be temporary, there is ongoing debate about whether — or how — the structure might be preserved. The UK’s University of Oxford may be closely associated with grand gothic architecture, but it also operates in an ever-evolving portfolio of contemporary properties scattered through the city. The latest of them, a new 270,000-square-foot life sciences building, concludes the largest construction project ever undertaken in the institution’s centuries-long history. The design principles of the Life and Mind Building reflect an academic one: that uniting the departments of experimental psychology and biology under one roof will encourage greater collaboration and engagement between them. Inside, flexible lab spaces accommodate the needs of the different disciplines while a public plaza offers the chance of more casual interactions. Despite plenty of modern touches, the American architecture practice behind the project, NBBJ, nods to the university’s architectural heritage through stone facades and projected buttresses that produce what it calls a “a timeless but recognizable appearance.” Organicarchitecture is often celebrated for blending (or even disappearing completely) into the landscape, leaving as little trace on the surroundings as possible. There’s perhaps no better example among this year’s new openings than architecture firm Sordo Madaleno’s Canadian School in Cholula, Mexico. The serene campus looks to the region’s topography for inspiration — namely a nearby pre-Hispanic pyramid and the Popocatépetl volcano, which serves as a dramatic backdrop. The school is arranged around seven circular structures that take the form of overlapping hills, their terraced surfaces providing green spaces for students to explore. Mexican architect Fernando Sordo Madaleno, grandson of the firm’s late founder Juan Sordo Madaleno, said in a statement that as well as blending with the environment, “the building itself becomes part of the playground.” Cambodia is replacing its capital Phnom Penh’s international airport with one capable of handling six times as many visitors. Part of the country’s ambitious bid to boost tourism numbers and become a regional aviation hub, the new Techo International Airport’s initial capacity of 13 million annual passengers will eventually rise to 30 million. The terminal building, located 12 miles south of the city center, will be one of Southeast Asia’s largest. Plans to generate energy through an onsite solar farm also put it among the world’s greenest, according to architects Foster + Partners. With a form inspired by traditional Cambodian design, the terminal’s main roof is supported by a series of structural timber “trees” (real trees will also rise through a large central void). Digital renderings show the structure’s gridded steel shell filtering daylight and illuminating an interior bursting with tropical greenery, while passengers will reach their gates via two airfoil-shaped wings. A major expansion of Boston’s South Station, the busiest ground transport hub in New England, is wrapping up this year. Upon completion, the redevelopment project will have increased the terminal’s bus capacity by 50%, while its rail capacity will be unaffected. Architecturally speaking, the challenge facing American firm Pelli Clarke & Partners was not only to reimagine the hub’s concourse and erect a soaring 51-story skyscraper above it, but to respect the original Classical Revival station building. Listed under the US National Register of Historic Places, it has stood there since 1899. The resulting contrast — between gleaming glass and weathered stone — was always going to be stark. But the tower’s soft, sculptural form seeks to complement its historic counterpart. The expanded, arched concourse meanwhile offers visitors a more grandiose arrival into the city. The first ever African winner of the Pritzker Prize, an award dubbed the “Nobel of architecture,”Francis Kéréis using his global profile to transform the built environment in his home continent. The Burkinabè architect is a longstanding champion of “vernacular” design, which looks to traditional building materials and construction techniques. And his vision for the new Senegalese branch of Goethe-Institut, the German cultural exchange center, is a case in point. The 18,300-square-foot building’s gentle curves were designed to mirror the outline of the surrounding canopies. It was constructed primarily from locally sourced bricks, which are made from compacted earth and arranged in lattice formations to encourage natural ventilation. Speaking to CNN in 2022, Kéré explained the importance of local materials, saying: “The more… you use, the better you can promote the local economy and (build) local knowledge, which also makes people proud.” More than a decade after the CCTV Headquarters in Beijing opened to become, arguably, China’s best-known contemporary building, its co-designer Ole Scheeren continues to leave his footprint on the county. The German architect’s firm, Büro Ole Scheeren, currently has majorprojects underwayin various Chinese cities, fromShenzhento Nanjing. Among the most striking among is Urban Glen, a pair of dramatically stepped towers containing nearly 900,000 square feet of office, hotel and leisure space in the eastern city of Hangzhou. Like the hills surrounding Hangzhou on three sides, the two volumes — one of which houses a Rosewood Hotel — appear to cascade into a manmade valley of roof terraces, shops and public art. The 2020s have seen Saudi Arabia announce a slew of mega-scale — and often bombastic — architectural ventures, from a new cityarranged in a lineto a cube-shaped skyscraper that will become one of the world’s largest built structures. But plans to bequeath the capital city Riyadh with a much-needed metro system date back more than a decade. Comprising six lines, the vast network is set to transform how the city operates, with a daily capacity of 3.6 million passengers. Above ground, its metro stations are becoming visual spectacles, with Zaha Hadid Architects and German firm Gerber Architekten among the high-profile foreign firms invited to design some of the 85 stations. While the project was inaugurated in November, and many of the lines went into operation last month, the project won’t be completed until the new year. Perhaps the most notable station yet to open is celebrated Norwegian firm Snøhetta’s Qasr Al Hokm — its striking stainless-steel canopy providing shade and channeling natural light into the cavernous interior. Europe continues to push the boundaries of wooden construction, with France now requiring all new public buildings to include at least 50% timber. Neighboring Luxembourg, meanwhile, is soon set to welcome one of the continent’s largest hybrid wooden buildings to date: the Skypark Business Center. Set across more than 844,000 square feet of floor space, it was built using over 542,000 cubic feet of timber — enough to fill up six Olympic-size pools — while the copper facade is made from 80% recycled metal. With its softly rounded edges, the structure’s unique shape can be understood as two alternating, zig-zagging strips that snake across one another along the site. Their various intersections create a series of courtyards and roof spaces, with the building’s occupants never more than 50 meters (164 feet) from a green terrace, according to architects BIG. The building, the first phase of which completes February, largely comprises office space, in addition to shops and a hotel. But ground-level courtyards will be open to passersby — and plane enthusiasts, who can enjoy views of the adjacent Luxembourg Airport. For almost nine years, the late Zaha Hadid’s firm has continued her legacy, producing dozens of new designs channeling the ethos and identity of an architect dubbed “Queen of the Curve.” But the Danjiang Bridge, in Taiwan, was announced in 2015 — the year before Hadid’s death — meaning it will be among the last projects to be realized that she personally oversaw. The 3,018-foot-long structure will connect four major highways over the mouth of the Tamsui River, which flows through Taiwan’s capital, Taipei. It features a surprisingly slender profile, with the entire structure supported by just a single concrete mast (which the firm’s project description says “minimizes” the bridge’s “visual impact” on its surroundings). Nonetheless, it will become the world’s longest single-mast asymmetrical cable-stayed bridge when it opens later this year. It is a sign of the architect’s unique aesthetic that, even with just one mast to play with, its rounded edges and gently warped form is still, somehow, signature Hadid.\n",
            "In one of the most anticipated debuts in NBA history,Luka Dončićintroduced himself toLakersfans in winning fashion, helping Los Angeles to a dominant 132-113 victory over the Utah Jazz on Monday night. The 25-year-old superstar received a raucous welcome from the home crowd at Crypto.com Arena, who were gifted No. 77 Dončić T-shirts in celebration of the blockbuster trade that brought him to theCity of Angelson February 2. “Special,” Dončić said of his first game in the famed purple and gold. “The way they received me, everybody, it was amazing to see. I was a little bit nervous before. I don’t remember when was the last time I was nervous before a game, but once I stepped out on the court, it was fun. Just being out there again felt amazing.” Playing for the first time since Christmas Day due to a left calf strain, Dončić showed some rust, finishing with 14 points on 5-of-14 shooting in 24 minutes of action. He also recorded five rebounds and four assists, giving the Lakers faithful a glimpse of what’s to come. The five-time All-NBA selectionwasted no time getting on the board, sinking a three-pointer from the top of the key in the opening minutes of the first quarter, leading to a loud  roar from the fans. Dončić shared the court with NBA all-time leading scorerLeBron James, who returned from a one-game absence to post a game-high 24 points, along with eight assists and seven rebounds. James, seen warming up in a No. 77 Dončić T-shirt, offered words of encouragement before the game: “Don’t fit in, fit the f**k out.” “It’s special for him to say something like that. It just feels amazing,” Dončić said. “It gives me confidence. And after that speech, there were chills. I was just happy to be a part of it.” Monday night’s contest wasn’t particularly competitive as the fourth-ranked Lakers cruised to a sixth straight win with the rout of the lowly Jazz. It was a who’s who in attendance to see Dončić, including Lakers superfans Adele and Will Ferrell, as well as Flea and Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Dallas Mavericks great Dirk Nowitzki was also in attendance. Nowitzki, who played his entire career with the Mavericks,explainedhis decision to attend: “I will always be a Mav for life, but had to come support my guy 77 in the first game of his new chapter.” With his long-awaited debut behind him, Dončić and the Lakers now set their sights on the Jazz again on Wednesday in Salt Lake City as they look to continue their charge up the Western Conference standings. A cornerstone of the league’s future, Dončić arrived in LA from Dallas as part of a three-team trade that sent shockwaves through the NBA. In exchange, the Mavericks acquired nine-time All-Star centerAnthony Davis, Max Christie and the Lakers’ 2029 first-round pick. The deal also saw Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris head to Los Angeles. Mavericks fans protested outside the team’s American Airlines Center before their game on Saturday, and after Davis’ promising debut was cut short by an adductor strain which could reportedly rule him out for up to a month, Dallas fans’ calls for the team’s general manager Nico Harrison to be fired and for the owners to sell the team have grown louder. Multiple fans were ejected from the arena during the second half of the Mavs’ 129-128 overtime loss to the Sacramento Kings on Monday due to them violating the NBA’s code of conduct, according to a team spokesperson. Two of the ejected fans held signs which read “Fire Nico,” according toESPN. “In the first incident, the guest brought in a sign that broke the following rule included in the NBA Code of Conduct: Clothing, garments or signs displaying explicit language, profanity or derogatory characterization towards any person(s),” Mavericks vice president of corporate communications Erin Finegold said in a statement sent to CNN. Two more men, one of whom was wearing Dončić’s Slovenian national team jersey, were also ejected after a shouting match with Mavs minority owner Mark Cuban, according to ESPN. “In the second incident, the fan wore a T-shirt that also broke the rule (cited) and was also intoxicated, disruptive and uncooperative, all listed in the NBA Fan Code of Conduct,” Finegold said in the statement. The Mavs’ injury woes also deepened on Monday, as the team lost center Daniel Gafford to a right knee sprain. Gafford had to be helped off the court in the second quarter, after suffering the injury setting a screen for Spencer Dinwiddie. With his injury, Dallas will now be without their frontcourt stars in Davis, Gafford, Dereck Lively II and Dwight Powell. Dallas sits eighth in the Western Conference on 28-26, half a game ahead of the Kings and the Golden State Warriors, each of which have won their last two.\n",
            "Hamas has postponed the next hostage release scheduled to take place in Gaza on Saturday “until further notice,” accusingIsraelof breaking the ceasefire deal. Israel described the postponement as a “complete violation of the ceasefire” and called on the Israeli military to prepare for “any possible scenario” in Gaza. US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, urged Israel to cancel the ceasefire and“let all hell break out”unless Hamas release all remaining hostages by Saturday, a demand that goes beyond the deal hashed out between the militant group and Israel and injects fresh uncertainty into an already fragile agreement. In a post on X published before Trump spoke, Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas’ armed wing the Qassam Brigades, said that the handover of the hostages “who were scheduled to be released next Saturday … will be postponed until further notice, and until the occupation commits to and compensates for the entitlements of the past weeks retroactively.” He added: “We affirm our commitment to the terms of the agreement as long as the occupation commits to them.” However, in a later statement, Hamas said there was still an opportunity for the release to go forward as planned. It said the move “serves as a warning” to Israel and was meant to pressure it into “fully honoring” the terms of theceasefire deal. “By issuing this statement five full days ahead of the scheduled prisoner handover, Hamas aims to grant mediators sufficient time to pressure the occupation to fulfill its obligations,” the statement read. “This also leaves the door open for the exchange to proceed as planned, provided the occupation complies.” Abu Obeida detailed various alleged violations of the agreement by Israel over the past three weeks, including “delaying the return of the displaced to the northern Gaza Strip, targeting them with shelling and gunfire in various areas of the strip, and not allowing the entry of relief supplies in all their forms according to what was agreed upon.” Hamas also accused Israel of not allowing tents, prefabricated houses, fuel, or rubble-removing mechanisms into the strip. It alleged Israel was also delaying the entry of essential medicines and hospital supplies. A diplomat with knowledge of the ceasefire talks claimed to CNN that the UN, Qatar and other countries had requested to deliver temporary shelters to Gaza but Israel turned them down. CNN has reached out to Israeli officials regarding the diplomat’s claim. In response to Hamas’ postponement, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said he had instructed the country’s military to “prepare at the highest level of alert for any possible scenario in Gaza.” The defense minister described Hamas’ move as a “complete violation of the ceasefire agreement and the deal to release the hostages.” The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said later it was “raising its level of readiness in southern Israel and postponing leave for combat soldiers” and would reinforce the area to enhance its “readiness for various scenarios.” An Israeli official told CNN Monday that Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahuwas consulting his security leadership team and that a political-security cabinet meeting scheduled for 7 p.m. on Tuesday local time had been moved up to the morning hours due to Hamas’ announcement. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, US President Trump said as far as he was concerned, “if all of the hostages aren’t returned by Saturday at 12 o’clock – I think it’s an appropriate time – I would say, cancel (the ceasefire) and all bets are off and let hell break out.” Pressed on what “all hell” might entail in Gaza, Trump demurred, adding “You’ll find out, and they’ll find out – Hamas will find out what I mean.” The US leader also expressed skepticism over how many hostages remain alive to release, saying, “I think a lot of the hostages are dead.” Trump’s statement was just the latest in a series of inflammatory remarks about Gaza in recent days, including proposals to permanently displace Palestinians from the strip. On Sunday, he doubled down on his plans forthe US to redevelop Gaza,calling the war-torn enclave as a “big real estate site.” It’s not clear how Trump’s proposals would be carried out, or if he even has the authority to do so – but they have bolstered Netanyahu and Israel’s far-right, and opened a host of legal questions. Opponents and many analysts have long warned the forcible removal of a population would breach international law. “I think it’s important to state very clearly upfront, there is no legitimate form of ethnic cleansing. It doesn’t matter if the proposal comes from the president of the United States,” said Khaled Elgindy, an expert on Middle East affairs and visiting scholar at Georgetown University. “I think the Arab states’ rejection of this is on that basis – it’s that you cannot remove Palestinians forcibly from their homeland. In addition to being illegal and immoral, it would be deeply destabilizing,” he added, referring to countries like Jordan and Egypt that have flatly rejected Trump’s plan. Hamas’ postponement of the next hostage release represents a serious challenge to the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas – but it does not guarantee the deal’s collapse. The movecomes at an extraordinarily sensitive time in Israel, where the images ofthree emaciated hostagesreleased on Saturday have been seared into the public conscience and are driving a sense of urgency about those still in captivity in Gaza. The Israeli government has also been dragging its feet on reengaging in negotiations with Hamas over extending the current ceasefire and right-wing politicians are already calling for a return to the war in Gaza. Underlining the high stakes involved for the Israeli government, protesters gathered in Tel Aviv on Monday night, calling for all remaining hostages to be released and accusing Netanyahu of sabotaging the deal. “The Israeli government just torpedoed the deal. The prime minister just torpedoed the deal, and the hostages are not expected to return on Shabbat. We cannot accept this,” Danny Elgarat, the brother of 69-year old Itzhak Elgarat, said in a video seen by CNN. Itzhak was supposed to be released under the first phase of the Gaza deal, according to the Israeli government. This is not the first time complaints have been raised to the mediators. Hamas and Israel have accused each other of violating the agreement throughout the first phase of the deal. Previous complaints have subsequently been resolved. An Israeli threat to delay the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza – which it followed through on – was ultimately resolved in discussions with the mediators, for example. Following the news, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum said it had requested urgent assistance from mediating countries to “help restore and implement” the ceasefire deal. “We stand with the Israeli government and encourage maintaining the conditions that will ensure the successful continuation of the agreement, leading to the safe return of our 76 brothers and sisters,” the forum said. “Recent evidence from those released, as well as the shocking conditions of the hostages released last Saturday, leaves no room for doubt,” the statement continued. “Time is of the essence, and all hostages must be urgently rescued from this horrific situation.” Hamas released three hostages on Saturday in the latesthostage exchange since a ceasefire went into effect on January 19. In exchange, Israel released 183 Palestinian prisoners, of whom 18 were serving life sentences. The majority had been detained in Gaza since October 7 and had no public charges against them. Hamas has now released a total of 16 Israeli hostages as part of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, of a total of 33 promised at staggered intervals during this stage. Eight of those 33 are dead, according to the Israeli government. Following the release of the three hostages on Saturday, Hamas and its allies still hold a total of 73 people taken from Israel onOctober 7, 2023, of 251 initially taken. Three additional hostages, held captive since 2014, are still in Gaza. The question now: How will the Israeli government react? This is a developing story and will be updated.\n",
            "North Korea has treated hundreds of Russian soldiers injured in Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Pyongyang told state media, as he revealed new details of the reclusive state’s backing for the Kremlin’s war effort. Wounded Russian troops have been recovering in North Korean medical facilities, Ambassador Alexander Matsegora told state-run outlet Rossiyskaya Gazeta in an extensive interview published Sunday. “A clear example of such a brotherly attitude (between Russian and North Korea) is the rehabilitation of hundreds of wounded soldiers … in Korean sanatoriums and hospitals,” he said. The Russian envoy’s comments are the latest sign of deepening ties between the two countries, which have recently reached heights unseen since the Cold War. North Korea has sent about 12,000 soldiersto Russia, according to Ukrainian officials and Western intelligence reports, following Moscow and Pyongyang’s pledge to help each other if either nation is attacked in a landmarkdefense pactsigned last June. About 4,000 North Korean troops have reportedly been killed or injured in combat after beingdeployed to Kursksince at least November to repel Ukraine’s incursion in the southern Russian border region, Ukrainian officials and Western intelligence said. Meanwhile, Russia has also received thousands of shipping containers of munitions or munitions-related material from North Korea, and Moscow’s forces have launchedNorth Korea-made missileson Ukraine, according to US officials. In his interview with state media, Matsegora claimed that North Korea had treated wounded Russian soldiers for free. “When we offered to compensate our (North Korean) friends for at least part of their expenses, they were sincerely offended and asked us never to do it again,” he said. Matsegora also said that children of Russian troops killed in Ukraine had vacationed in North Korea last summer, and Russia and North Korea are developing student exchanges. Moscow supplies Pyongyang with coal, food, and medicine, he added. South Korea’s intelligence service declined to comment on Matsegora’s remarks. The extent of care potentially available to wounded Russian troops within North Korea’s dilapidated health infrastructure remains unclear. Doctors who have defected in recent years often speak ofpoor working conditionsand shortages of everything from medicine to basic health care supplies. Some analysts also cast doubt on Matsegora’s troop recuperation remarks, pointing to Russia’s brutal military tactics as the war in Ukraine grinds toward its third anniversary. Russia “has reportedly been sending wounded personnel back into assault groups without treatment, demonstrating a general disregard for soldiers’ health,”The Institute for the Study of Warsaid in a news release Monday, “calling into question official Russian claims to be sending Russian soldiers abroad for treatment, particularly to North Korea.” However, any arrival of experienced Russian troops, particularly officers, in North Korea “may allow the Russian military to work with North Korean forces and disseminate lessons from the war in Ukraine while ostensibly recuperating,” the US-based conflict monitor added.\n",
            "Three male Israeli hostages and 183 Palestinian prisoners were freed in thefifth round of exchangesbetween Israel and Hamas Saturday, but the gaunt, frail appearance of the released hostages was condemned as “shocking” by Israel. A group representing the families of hostages held in Gaza said it was “horrified by the visible physical and mental condition” of Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy, who were paraded on a makeshift stage before the handover. The three men – all taken hostage during the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel – were handed to the Red Cross in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah on day 491 of their captivity. While the transfer was orderly – in contrast to chaotic scenes surrounding the release of Israeli and Thai hostages in Gaza last week – the three appeared thin and pale. On stage and surrounded by Hamas militants, Ben Ami and Sharabi, who were dressed in brown, and Levy, who was dressed in green, delivered speeches in Hebrew. They were then led to three Red Cross vehicles waiting to take them back to Israel. The Red Cross then passed the hostages to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, who  transferred them back to Israel, where they underwent an initial medical assessment before being reunited with their families. Following their transfer, Hamas also released a highly produced propaganda video showing the three men together inside a tunnel, in a departure from previous hostage releases. Israel later released all 183 Palestinian prisoners due to be freed on Saturday, 18 of whom were serving life sentences. Many of them appeared emaciated and in poor health. The scenes during Saturday’s hostage handover have drawn condemnation from Israel. Levy – who was released as he was considered a humanitarian case – appeared particularly frail. The Israeli government described the scenes as “shocking” and said they “would not go unaddressed,” while Israel’s Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the freed hostages’ appearances were “disturbing.” The Nir Oz kibbutz in southern Israel, among the hardest hit in the October 7 attacks, said it was “happy and excited” for the hostages’ return Saturday, adding: “These images and the conditions in which they returned will be etched in the memory of the world and will be eternal testimony to the failure, to all who chose to oppose the deal, to all who continue to explain why we should wait, postpone or hesitate.” Ben Ami, 56, and Sharabi, 52, were both taken from their homes in Kibbutz Be’eri, about four kilometers (2.5 miles) from the Gaza border. Ben Ami’s wife, Raz Ben Ami, also taken captive that day, was freed during ashort-lived truce in November 2023. Sharabi’s wife and daughters were killed in the October 7 attack, according to the kibbutz. It is unclear if he knew they were killed. His brother Yossi Sharabi, who was taken captive, died in Gaza, where his body remains, according to the Israeli military. Levy, 34, was attending the Nova music festival on October 7 when he was kidnapped. His wife, Eynav, was killed in the attack. Following his release, Levy’s mother Geula told Israel’s Channel 12 that she was sad to see the hostages “thin and pale,” but added that “slowly, slowly everything will work out.” She added that Levy and his 3-year-old son, Almog, had reunited. “(They) met as if nothing had happened as far as Almog was concerned, as if nothing had happened. Now they are playing,” Geula Levy said. In another interview with Israel’s public broadcaster Kan 11 News, she said that Levy did not know that his wife had died. “He did not know. He assumed, and asked, and we told him,” his mother said. Ruby and Hagit Chen, the parents of Itay Chen, a US hostage in Gaza, said “the pictures of Or, Ohad and Eli simultaneously widen and stab our hearts.” They urged US President Donald Trump to push to include six US citizens still held by Hamas in the next phase of the hostage release deal. The Hope (Tikva) Forum, which represents the families of some of the hostages, said Saturday it was “horrified by the visible physical and mental condition of Eli, Or, and Ohad. These images are haunting us and will not let us rest.” “We will continue to fight and struggle until the last hostage is brought home,” the group added. Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon sent a letter to the UN Secretary-General António Guterres demanding that he “publicly condemn” Hamas “following the dire physical condition of the three Israeli hostages.” Netanyahu said in a video message from Washington, DC, following the release of three Israeli hostages, that his country “will do everything to bring all our hostages back.” The news came as Netanyahu approved sending a delegation to Doha to discuss the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal. An Israeli official described the delegation to CNN on Saturday as “mid-level” and said it would “discuss technical details of the agreement.” The official said the team would not be discussing the second phase of the deal. Hamas has now released a total of 16 Israeli hostages as part of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, of a total of 33 promised at staggered intervals during this stage. Eight of those 33 are dead, according to the Israeli government. Following the release of the three hostages on Saturday, Hamas and its allies still hold a total of 73 people taken from Israel onOctober 7, 2023, of 251 initially taken. Three additional hostages, held captive since 2014, are still in Gaza. Meanwhile, Israel freed 183 Palestinians Saturday. Some of the released prisoners were taken from Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank to Ramallah, where video of their release showed some detainees weak and thin, with one man appearing so frail that he needed to be carried. Recently released Palestinian prisoners have returned from Israeli detention with signs of physical abuse and starvation, and have alleged abuse and torture. The Israeli prison system has come under fire for intentionally reducing food servings to Palestinian prisoners in what’s been described as the minimum required for survival, on the orders of then National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir last year. In comments made in April 2024, Ben Gvir said that Palestinian prisoners “should be killed with a shot to the head,” and called for a bill to allow for executions to be passed in the Israeli Knesset. “Until then, we will give them minimal food to survive. I do not care about this,” he said. In October, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that conditions in the notorious Sde Teiman detention center must comply with Israeli law. A spokesperson for the Israel Prison Service told CNN Saturday that the IPS “operates according to the provisions of the law” and that “all basic rights required are fully applied by professionally trained prison guards.” Eighteen of the Palestinian prisoners released Saturday were serving life sentences, while 54 had lesser sentences and 111 were detained in Gaza after October 7, Hamas said in a statement. The charges against the 111 were not clear. Palestinian militants killed more than 1,200 people during the October 7, 2023, attack. Israeli bombardment of Gaza since has killed more than 48,000 people, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, reduced much of the enclave to rubble, and led to a humanitarian catastrophe for surviving residents. The war has spilled over into the wider region, putting Israel in conflict with key Hamas backer Iran, as well as Tehran proxies such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Uncertainty looms over the future of the ceasefire and hostage agreement between Israel and Hamas. Negotiations on extending the Gaza ceasefire – which expires on March 1 – are in doubt. Netanyahu has been deeply wary of phase two of that deal, which would see the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the return of the remaining hostages there. His finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has pledged to quit the government if the ceasefire continues. This story has been updated with additional details.\n",
            "An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 occurred on Saturday in the Caribbean Sea, according to the US Geological Survey, sparking a tsunami advisory. The tremor hit 129 miles southwest of Georgetown, Cayman Islands, at 6.23 p.m. ET Saturday, the USGS reported. The US National Tsunami Warning Center (NWTC) initially said there was a tsunami threat to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Residents in those places were advised to move out of the water, off the beach and away from harbors, marinas, bays and inlets, and not go to shore to observe the tsunami. The center later canceled the advisory for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, but said advisories were still in place for Cuba – where tsunami waves of between 1 and 3 meters above tide level are possible – and Honduras and the Cayman Islands, where waves of 30 centimeters to 1 meter above tide level are possible. These waves are expected between 8 p.m. ET and 10:30 p.m. ET. This story has been corrected to more accurately reflect the location of the earthquake.\n",
            "When Delphyne Dabezies first announced her plans to launch Africa’s first caviar manufacturer, some in the luxury food industry were incredulous. But now, 15 years since founding her company, Acipenser, with its Rova and Kasnodar Caviar brands, Dabezies’ products have made their way into some of the most prestigious kitchens in the world. High in the mountains of Madagascar, just east of the capital Antananarivo, Lake Mantasoa has emerged as an unlikely source of this opulent ingredient. “Every expert was saying it was impossible,” Dabezies told CNN. Caviar is a delicacy made from the salted eggs of sturgeon fish. Traditionally sourced from Russia’s Caspian Sea, it gained luxury status in the 17th century after Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich I made caviar a state monopoly. Production soon spread around the world. With the establishment of Acipenser in Madagascar, caviar is now produced on every inhabited continent other than Australia. Due both to its cultural significance and the long maturation period of sturgeon fish – between eight and 20 years – caviar can fetch﻿ prices as high as $27,000 a teaspoon. And then there is the coveted taste. “You just sort of press it against your palate,” Nichola Fletcher, author of “Caviar: A Global History,” told CNN, “and the little eggs dissolve into deliciousness.” Inspired by a television program on sturgeon farming in France, French trio Dabezies, her husband Christophe, and their friend Alexandre Guerrier, decided to pursue a similar project in their adopted home of Madagascar, where they were already working in the textile trade. Dabezies said they began “without any knowledge” of caviar production. “Nobody in the beginning though it was possible, and nobody wanted to help us,” Dabezies said. It took the arrival of a retired sturgeon farming expert Francoise Rennes, on vacation in Madagascar, to help them get their project of the ground. And then one day, driving to their weekend house, they saw the lake. Lake Mantasoa is situated at an altitude of approximately 1,400 meters (4,590 feet) in the Madagascan highlands, a temperate zone atypical for the tropics. It turned out to be “absolutely the perfect environment to grow the sturgeon,” said Dabezies. Unlike in the Northern Hemisphere where low water temperatures can cause the fish to stop growing, Lake Mantasoa ranges between 13 and 23 degrees Celsius, allowing the fish to grow year-round. Consequently, Dabezies’s fish mature around two years faster. Soon, the dream of three novice sturgeon farmers became a reality. Today, their caviar production comprises both land and lake-based ponds in Madagascar, farming six species of sturgeon. The culinary world was wary when Acipenser produced the first batch of its premium Rova Caviar, named after the historical Madagascan Queen’s Palace in Antananarivo, in 2017. Madagascar is known for its vanilla, not its fish eggs. “At the beginning it was difficult,” said Dabezies. “Everyone was laughing – it was a joke. But the only way to prove that the caviar is excellent is to taste it.” The opportunity arrived when Europe’s top chefs sampled the produce at the prestigious culinary expo Sirha Lyon in 2019. Since then, Rova Caivar has appeared on high-end menus around the world, including the five-star Hôtel de Crillon in Paris and the Hôtel du Palais in Biarritz. “Here we have a caviar that is full of indulgence,” said Julia Sedefjian, who was the youngest ever chef to run a Michelin-starred kitchen in France, and who created a dish with Rova Caviar for last December’s La Grande Tablée in Paris, a gala dinner presented by nonprofit La Tablée des Chefs. “A caviar that could suit all palates, (with a) buttery, brioche-like and hazelnut flavor on the finish.” The caviar has proved popular in Africa, too; Le Saint-Gerán Hotel in Mauritius, and the Constance Lemuria and Constance Ephelia in the Seychelles have all served it. “For chefs now, it’s a selling point to have caviar from Madagascar on the plate,” Dabezies argued. Rova’s most expensive product sells for €11,670 (around $11,960) per kilogram. Madagascar is one of the most biodiverse countries on Earth and is home to thousands of species found nowhere else in the world. Dabezies, along with Christophe and Guerrier, has lived there for nearly 30 years. “It’s given us a lot,” she said, and so “the most important thing is that the business provides a profit to local people and to the country.” Acipenser employs around 300 people, 80% of whom are from the local municipality of Ambatolaona. The company provides training in fish farming and caviar production, and offers medical coverage, literacy courses and family planning education. It has recently been granted a lease by the government that will allow it to re-forest and protect 200 hectares of hills around Lake Mantasoa. Acipenser says it is taking steps to ensure the lake’s sustainability, including by restocking it to support local fisheries, installing a water monitoring system, and facilities to prevent water pollution. The ultimate goal for many caviar makers is to produce Beluga caviar, the most expensive and luxurious form of caviar, made from the Beluga sturgeon, the species that takes the longest to mature and that produces the biggest eggs. As of last year, Acipenser had its first Beluga fish in Madagascar. This year, it is aiming to produce Beluga caviar for the first time. “Madagascar is a unique place with incredible potential,” Dabezies said, “We are proud to be a part of its story and to share its treasures with the world.”\n",
            "US PresidentDonald Trumpsuggested thatUkraine“may be Russian someday,” throwing into question the future independence of a sovereign country that, with Western backing, has defended itself against Moscow’s full-scale invasion for nearly three years. Trump discussed his administration’s effort to end the war in an interview with Fox News that aired Monday, ahead of a meeting tabled for this week between his vice president, JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. “They (Ukraine) may make a deal, they may not make a deal. They may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday,” Trump said. He stressed that he also wanted to see a return on investment with US aid for Ukraine, again floating the idea of a trade for Kyiv’s rare earth minerals. The US president’s comments will likely delight the Kremlin, which has illegally annexed four Ukrainian regions since launching its full-scale invasion and seeks Ukraine’s total submission. “A significant part of Ukraine wants to become Russia, and the fact that it has already become Russia is (undeniable),” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday, when asked about Trump’s comments. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, it believed it would capture the capital Kyiv in days and the rest of the country in weeks. With the war set to enter its fourth year later this month, Moscow holds around a fifth of Ukraine’s territory. In 2023, it held asham referendumin four occupied regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – in an attempt to lend legitimacy to its annexation. Peskov said people had “despite many dangers, stood in line and voted” in the referendum to join Russia. “This largely corresponds to President Trump’s words,” he added. CNNreportedat the time on the stage-managed referendum, which international observers dismissed as a propaganda exercise. In the Fox News interview, Trump said his administration had made “tremendous progress” in laying the ground for potential peace talks with Russia and Ukraine. Zelensky said Monday that “some serious people” from the Trump administration will visit Ukraine this week ahead of the Munich Security Conference in Germany, where Zelensky is set to meet with Vance. Trump repeated his interest in reaping a return on US assistance for Kyiv. “They have tremendously valuable land in terms of rare earth, in terms of oil and gas, in terms of other things. I want to have our money secured,” he said. “I told them that I want the equivalent, like $500 billion of rare earth, and they’ve essentially agreed to do that, so at least we don’t feel stupid. Otherwise we’re stupid. I said to them, we have to get something. We can’t continue to pay this money,” he added. Whereas the Biden administrationsaidits support for Kyiv was to defend “the right of people to determine their own futures,” and to maintain “the principle that a country can’t change its neighbor’s borders by force,” Trump’s comments reinforce his more transactional approach to geopolitics. Trump’s comments will likely come as a boon to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has sought to justify his invasion of Ukraine by falselyassertingthat Russians and Ukrainians are “one people – a single whole,” and that Ukraine is not a sovereign country. With some European leaders preparing to meet senior members of the Trump administration in Munich this week, Poland’s President Andrzej Duda stressed on Tuesday that Russia “cannot draw benefit” from its war in Ukraine and should not emerge victorious. Speaking to CNN on the sidelines of the World Government Summit in Dubai, Duda said that in a “perfect scenario Ukraine should regain all the land that is occupied by Russia today,” but conceded that the priority now is to ensure that “the war is stopped” not according to “Russian conditions.”\n",
            "Pacific allies don’t usually air their dirty laundry in public. But a rare on-the-record dispute between New Zealand and Kiribati has renewed focus on the poor and isolated island nation, highlighting the existential threat it faces from the climate crisis – against the backdrop of a tussle between the world’s biggest powers forregional dominance. When New Zealand’s right-wing government unexpectedly announced an aid review for its Pacific neighbor last week – ostensibly over an alleged snub to a top official – it “caused serious anxiety” for the approximately 120,000 people who live in Kiribati,accordingto one i-Kiribati minister. Foreign aid accounted for 18% of Kiribati’s national income in 2022, according to the Lowy Institute – with New Zealand among its largest donors. The Micronesian nation of 33 coral islands is scattered over a remote area of the central Pacific that spans 3.5 million square kilometers (1.3 million square miles) – an area larger than India. Though among the least populated countries, Kiribati has one of the world’s largest exclusive economic zones. Its relative proximity to Hawaii and United States military bases in Guam also gives it strategic importance as great powerscompete for influencein the vast waterways between Asia and the Americas. The diplomatic fallout has put fresh attention on the battle for influence in the Pacific between China and Western nations, mainly the United States. It also comes as US President Donald Trump’s administration threatens to disruptAmerican relations in the region, with concerns from Pacific leaders over how US withdrawals from the Paris climate agreement and World Health Organization, as well as a 90-day aid freeze, will impact vulnerable communities. The dispute erupted last week with a sudden move from New Zealand’s deputy prime minister. Winston Peters, also New Zealand’s foreign minister, put tens of millions of dollars in assistance for Kiribati under review after President Taneti Maamau pulled out of a planned meeting, Peters’ spokesperson told CNN. Peters had planned to lead a delegation to Kiribati last month, which included the handover of a New Zealand-funded $14 millionhospital upgrade. But a week before they were set to arrive, Kiribati told the delegation that Maamau, who is also the country’s foreign minister, “was no longer available” to receive them, Peters’ spokesperson said. “The lack of political-level contact makes it very difficult for us to agree joint priorities for our development program, and to ensure that it is well targeted and delivers good value for money,” Peters’ office added. Between 2021 and 2024, New Zealand’s aid commitments to Kiribati totaled $57 million, with investments in health, education, fisheries, economic development, and climate resilience. An analyst said New Zealand’s surprising move to review the entire assistance package was born out of “deep frustration” from Peters “that a number of diplomatic efforts to engage with the Kiribati government have been rebuffed.” “New Zealand has struggled to get access with the Kiribati government, including across those key areas in which New Zealand is supporting health, climate and education, for instance,” said Anna Powles, associate professor at the Centre for Defence and Security Studies at Massey University in New Zealand. Kiribati framed the situation as a misunderstanding, however. In a statement, the Kiribati President’s Office said it was “surprised to learn” there were media reports on Peters’ visit, “which was still under active negotiations based on the understanding that alternative dates were to be explored.” The dispute may reflect concern shared among Western countries that their interests in the Pacific are being weakened by China’s diplomatic and economic outreach, experts say. Maamau had embarked on a visit to two of Kiribati’s nearest neighbors when the dispute became public. “Kiribati has clearly indicated who its preferred partners are in the region: Fiji, Nauru and then, of course, China,” Powles said. “Both New Zealand, as we’ve just seen, and Australia have had challenges in terms of engaging with Kiribati and getting the type of access that they would hope to get. Whereas China has not had those same challenges at all.” Many Pacific nations have forged closer ties with Beijing in recent years. In 2019, pro-China President Maamau oversaw Kiribati’s switch in diplomatic ties from Taiwan to China, one of several Pacific countries to do so. Under Maamau, who was re-elected to a third term in October last year, Kiribati has taken an authoritarian and isolationist turn, critics say. A prominent opposition leader last year raised concerns over a lack of transparency about10 agreements signedbetween Kiribati and China in 2022. Tensions rose that year when Maamau alsopulled outof the Pacific Islands Forum, threatening the unity of the 18-member grouping at a time when the region faced increased geopolitical pressure. It rejoined in 2023, though some suspected Beijing’s hand in the decision to leave, a claim China’s Foreign Ministry rejected as “completely groundless.” Pacific security partners Australia, New Zealand and the US have also expressed concern about the presence of uniformed Chinese officers on Kiribati and the Solomon Islands. New Zealand going public with the spat was “not smart diplomacy,” said Jon Fraenkel, professor in comparative politics at Victoria University of Wellington. But it was unlikely that Wellington would ultimately cut the aid package, he added. And though Beijing is a significant partner, “the level of Chinese assistance to Kiribati has not been extraordinarily large,” Fraenkel said. “A lot of it is just grant assistance, which may or may not have some kind of developmental impact.” Concerns over Beijing’s influence in the region were reinforced when the Cook Islands’ Prime Minister Mark Brownannounceda state visit to China this week to discuss a strategic partnership agreement. The Cook Islands is in free association with New Zealand, which means its people hold New Zealand citizenship. “There are a number of issues,” on which New Zealand and the Cook Islands governments “currently do not see eye to eye,” a spokesperson for New Zealand’s foreign ministry told CNN, including a lack of transparency over “policies and partnerships with other countries.” The ministry said it expects the Cook Islands government to fully consult Wellington on “any major international agreements” that have “major strategic and security implications.” Under former President Joe Biden, the US ramped up rhetoric, as well as defense and security assistance to the Pacific to counter China’s growing regional influence. It signed security agreements with Papua New Guinea and Fiji, renewed the Compacts of Free Association with Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, and opened an embassy in the Solomon Islands. But US aid to the Pacific only accounted for 7% of oversees funding to the region in 2022, according to the Lowy Insitute’s Pacific Aid Map. “There is a sense of concern that the US was not able to make as many inroads into the region as many partners in the Pacific had hoped,” Powles said. The Biden administration unsuccessfully attempted to reopen an embassy in Kiribati and the US has “very little leverage on the ground,” she added. And with Trump back in power, there is more concern that cuts toUSAID, and Washington’s impending withdrawals from the Paris climate agreement and WHO “will further undermine the US’ reputation in the region,” Powles said. The climate crisis is one of the region’s biggest security concerns. The Pacific Islands are among the most climate vulnerable places and are disproportionately affected by a warming world despite contributing the least to global emissions. Rising and warming seas, the loss of coral reefs, acidic oceans, dwindling supplies of fresh water and fish, as well as disaster recovery support from more powerful cyclones are among the most pressing concerns. Papua New Guinea’s Prime Minister James Marape said last month that the US withdrawing from the climate agreement was “totally irresponsible.” “Good global leaders are also responsible world statesmen. They take responsibility not just for their own countries, but also for the planet,” he said, according toCNN affiliate Radio New Zealand. As well as setting the US back on its own climate commitments, the withdrawal would impact funds for climate resiliency, disaster relief, and health. “Trump’s strategy in the Pacific will be both deeply transactional but also prioritizing security over other forms of assistance and cooperation,” Powles said. Among the tranche of executive actions Trump signed on his first day in office was an order to increase US Coast Guard presence around the world, including in the Pacific. With Trump’s transactional nature, there are concerns Pacific Islands would be forced to choose between China and US assistance, Powles added. But the island countries “are not fools,” said Fraenkel, of Victoria University of Wellington. “Certainly, anything that isolates Kiribati from New Zealand or Australia makes it more likely that they’ll look elsewhere,” he added. But the impression that the island states are “just simply being seduced by the baubles of Beijing, is a slightly crude characterization.”\n",
